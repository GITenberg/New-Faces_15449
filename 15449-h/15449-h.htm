<p>A business meeting of the Lady Hyacinths
Shirt-Waist Club was in progress.
The roll had been called. The
twenty members were all present and the
Secretary had read the minutes of the last
meeting. These formalities had consumed
only a few moments and the club was ready
to fall upon its shirt waists. The sewing-machines
were oiled and uncovered, the cutting-table
was cleared, every Hyacinth had
her box of sewing paraphernalia in her lap;
and Miss Masters who had been half cajoled
and half forced into the management of this
branch of the St. Martha's Settlement Mission
was congratulating herself upon the ease
and expedition with which her charges were
learning to transact their affairs, when the
President drew a pencil from her pompadour
and rapped professionally on the table. In
her daytime capacity of saleslady in a Grand
Street shoe store she would have called
&quot;cash,&quot; but as President of the Lady Hyacinths
her speech was:</p>

<p>&quot;If none of you goils ain't got no more
business to lay before the meetin' a movement
to adjoin is in order.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I move we adjoin an git to woik,&quot; said
Mamie Kidansky promptly. Only three
buttonholes and the whalebones which would
keep the collar well up behind the ears lay
between her and the triumphant rearing of
her shirt waist. Hence her zeal.</p>

<p>Susie Meyer was preparing to second the
motion. As secretary she disapproved of
much discussion. She was always threatening
to resign her portfolio vowing, with some
show of reason, &quot;I never would 'a' joined
your old Hyacinths Shirt-Waists if I'd a'
known I was goin' to have to write down all
the foolish talk you goils felt like givin' up.&quot;</p>

<p>It seemed therefore that the business meeting
was closed, when a voice from the opposite
side of the table broke in with:</p>

<p>&quot;Say, Rosie, why can't us goils give a
play?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah Jennie, you make me tired,&quot; protested
the Secretary.</p>

<p>&quot;An' you're out of order anyway,&quot; was
the President's dictum.</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; cried Jennie wildly, clutching
her pompadour with one hand and the back
of her belt with the other, &quot;where, what's
the matter with me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go 'way back an' sit down,&quot; was the
Secretary's advice, &quot;Rosie meant you're out
of parliamentry order. We got a motion
on the table an' it's too late for you to butt
in on it. This meetin' is goin' to adjoin.&quot;</p>

<p>But Jennie was the spokesman of a newly-born
party and her supporters were not going
to allow her to be silenced. Even those
Lady Hyacinths who had not been admitted
to earlier consultations took kindly to the
suggestion when they heard it.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't care whether she's out of order
or not,&quot; one ambitious Hyacinth declared,
&quot;I think it would be just too lovely for anything
to have a play. They have 'em all
the time over to Rivington Street an' down
to the Educational Alliance.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Rebecca Einstein,&quot; said the Secretary
darkly, &quot;if you're goin' to fire off your face
about plays an' the Educational Alliances
you can keep your own minnits, that's all!
Do ye think I'm goin' to write down your
foolishness? Well, I ain't.&quot;</p>

<p>Again the President plied her gavel.
&quot;Goils,&quot; she remonstrated, &quot;this ain't no
way to act. Say, Miss Masters,&quot; she went
on, &quot;I guess the whole lot of us is out of order
now. What would you do about it if you
was me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should suggest,&quot; Miss Masters answered,
&quot;that the motion to adjourn be carried
and that the whole club go into
committee on the question raised by Miss
Meyer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I move that we take our woik into committee
with us,&quot; cried Miss Kidansky, not
to be deflected from her buttonholes. And
from such humble beginnings the production
of Hamlet by the Lady Hyacinths sprang.</p>

<p>Hamlet was not their first choice. It was
not even their tenth and to the end it was
not the unanimous choice. During the preliminary
stages of the dramatic fever Miss
Masters preserved that strict neutrality
which marks the successful Settlement
worker. She would help&mdash;oh, surely she
would help&mdash;the Hyacinths, but she would
not lead them. She had never questioned
their taste in the shape and color of their
shirt waists. Some horrid garments had
resulted but to her they represented &quot;self
expression,&quot; and as such gave her more
pleasure than any servile following of her
advice could have done. She soon discovered
that the latitude in the shirt waist field
is far exceeded by that in the dramatic and
she discovered too, that the Lady Hyacinths,
though they seldom visited the theatre
had strong digestions where plays were
concerned.</p>

<p>&quot;East Lynne&quot; was warmly advocated until
some one discovered a grandmother who
had seen it in her youth. Then:</p>

<p>&quot;Ah gee!&quot; remarked the Lady Hyacinths,
&quot;we ain't no grave snatchers. We ain't
goin' to dig up no dead ones. Say Miss
Masters, ain't there no new plays we could
give?&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Masters referred them to the public
library, but not many plays are obtainable
in book form, and the next two meetings
were devoted to the plays of Ibsen, Bernard
Shaw, Vaughan Moody. When Miss Masters
descried this literature in the hands of
the now openly mutinous Secretary she felt
the time had come to interfere with
the &quot;self activity&quot; of her charges. She
promptly confiscated the second volume of
&quot;G.B.S.&quot; &quot;For,&quot; she explained &quot;we don't
want to do anything unpleasant and the
writer of these plays himself describes them
as that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Guess we don't,&quot; the President agreed.
&quot;We got to live up to our name, ain't we?
An' what could be pleasanter than a
Hyacinth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, of course,&quot; agreed Miss Masters
unsteadily.</p>

<p>&quot;There's one in this Ibsen book might
do,&quot; Jennie suggested. &quot;It's called 'A
Dolls' House,' that's a real sweet name.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid it wouldn't do,&quot; said Miss
Masters hastily.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with it?&quot; demanded
Susie Meyer.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, in the first place, there are children
in it&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cut it! 'Nough said,&quot; pronounced the
President. &quot;Them plays wid kids in 'em
is all out of style. We giv' 'East Lynne'
the turn down an' there was only one kid
in that. What else have you got in that
Gibson book? Have you got the play with
the Gibson goils in it? We could do that all
right, all right. Ain't most of us got Gibson
pleats in our shirt waists?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see nothin' about goils,&quot; the
Secretary made answer, &quot;but there's one
here about ghosts. How would that do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all,&quot; said Miss Masters firmly.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with it?&quot; asked one
of the girls abandoning her sewing-machine
and coming over to the table. &quot;I seen
posters of it last year. They are givin' it
in Broadway. The costoomes would be real
easy, just a sheet you know and your hair
hanging down.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not about that kind of ghost,&quot; Miss
Masters explained, &quot;and I don't think it
would do for us as there are very few people
in the cast and one of them is a minister.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cut it,&quot; said the President briefly, &quot;we
ain't goin' to have no hymn singin' in ours.
We couldn't, you know,&quot; she explained to
Miss Masters, &quot;the most of us is Jewesses.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Katie McGuire ain't no Jewess,&quot; asserted
the Secretary. &quot;She could be the
minister if that's all you've got against this
Gibson play. I wish we <i>could</i> give it. It's
about the only up-to-date Broadway success
we can find. The librarian says you can't
never buy copies of Julia Marlowe's an'
Ethel Barrymore's an' Maude Adams' plays.
I guess they're just scared somebody like
us will come along an' do 'em better than
they do an' bust their market. Actresses,&quot;
she went on, &quot;is all jest et up with jealousy
of one another. Is there anythin' except
the minister the matter with 'Ghosts?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Everything else is the matter with it,&quot;
said Miss Masters. &quot;To begin with, I might
as well tell you, it never was a Broadway
success. It's a play that is read oftener than
it's acted and last year, Jennie, when you
saw the posters, it only ran for a week.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cut it,&quot; said the President. &quot;We ain't
huntin' frosts.&quot;</p>

<p>The brows of the Hyacinths grew furrowed
and their eyes haggard in the search.
Everyone could tell them of plays but no
one knew where they could be found in
printed form and whenever the librarian
found something which might be suitable
Miss Masters was sure to know of something
to its disadvantage.</p>

<p>And then the real stage, the legitimate
Broadway stage intervened. Albert Marsden
produced Hamlet and the Lady Hyacinths
determined to follow suit.</p>

<p>&quot;It's kind of old,&quot; the President admitted,
&quot;but there must be some style left to it.
They're playin' it on Broadway right now.
An' we'll give it on East Broadway just as
soon as we can git ready. Me and Mamie
went round to the library last night an' got
it out. It's got a dandy lot of parts in it:
more than this club will ever need. An'
it's got lots of murders an' scraps, an' court
ladies an' soldiers an' kings. It's our play
all right!&quot;</p>

<p>The sea of troubles into which the Lady
Hyacinths plunged with so much enthusiasm
swallowed them so completely that
Miss Masters could only stand on its shore,
looking across to Denmark and wringing her
hands over the awful things that were happening
in that unhappy land. Fortunately
she had a friend to whom she could appeal
for succour for the lost but still valiant Hyacinths.
He was the sort of person to whom
appeals came as naturally as honors come to
some men and, since he had nothing to do
and ample time and money with which to
do it, he was generally helpful and resourceful.
That he had once loved Miss Masters
has nothing to do with this story. She was
now engaged to be married to a poorer and
busier man, but it was to Jack Burgess that
she appealed.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course I know,&quot; said he when he had
responded to her message and she had
anchored him with a tea-cup and disarmed
him with a smile, &quot;of course I know what
you want to say to me. Every girl who has
refused me has said it sooner or later. You
are saying it later&mdash;much later&mdash;than they
generally do, but it always comes. 'You
have found a wife for me.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have done much better than that,&quot;
she answered, &quot;I have found work for you.&quot;
And she sketched the distress of the Hyacinths
in Denmark and urged him to go to
their assistance.</p>

<p>&quot;But, my dear Margaret,&quot; he remonstrated,
&quot;What can I do? You have always
known that 'something is rotten in the state
of Denmark,' and yet you have let these
poor innocents stir it up. I have often
thought that poor Shakespeare added that
line after the first performance. I intend
to write that hint to Furniss one of these
days.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will write it,&quot; said Margaret Masters,
&quot;with more conviction after you have
seen <i>my</i> Denmark.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; said he, &quot;I'll visit Elsinore
to-night, but I insist upon a return ticket.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will be begging for a season ticket,&quot;
she laughed. &quot;They have reduced me to
such a condition that I don't know whether
they are amusing me or breaking my heart.
Tell me, come, which is it? Did you ever
hear blank verse recited with tense and
reverent earnestness and a Bowery accent?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I never did,&quot; said he.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;Shakespeare was right,&quot; whispered Burgess
to Miss Masters. &quot;There is something
rotten in Denmark. I've located it. It's
the Prince.&quot; They were sitting together
in a corner of the kindergarten room of the
settlement: a large and spacious room all
decked and bright with the paper and cardboard
masterpieces of the babies who played
and learned there in the mornings. Casts
and pictures and green growing things added
to its charm and the Lady Hyacinths so
trim and neat and earnest did not detract
from it.</p>

<p>The sewing-machines and the cutting-table
had been cast into corners and well
in the glare of the electric light the President
was exclaiming in a voice which would
have disgraced an early phonograph, &quot;Oh
that this too too solid flesh would melt.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not a dress rehearsal but the too
solid Prince wore his hair low on his neck
and a golden fillet bound his brows. Silent,
he was noble. His walk as he came in at
the end of a procession of court ladies and
gentlemen was magnificent&mdash;slow, dejected,
imperious, aloof. But Wittenberg had a
great deal to answer for, if he had contracted
his accent there.</p>

<p>Gertrude, Queen of Denmark, was a Hyacinth
who worked daily at hooks and buttonholes
for an East Broadway tailor. On this
night she wore none of her regalia save her
crown and the King had done nothing at all
to differentiate himself from Susie Lacov
who officiated as waitress in a Jewish lunchroom.</p>

<p>The Hyacinths had wisely decided to edit
Hamlet. In this they followed an almost
universal principle and their method was
also time-honored. All the scenes in which
unimportant members of the club or cast
&quot;came out strong,&quot; were eliminated. So
far the Hyacinths were orthodox, but Rosie
Rosenbaum, Prince, President and Censor,
went a step further.</p>

<p>&quot;Git busy. Mix her up, why don't you!&quot;
she commanded later from the wings.
The other players were laboriously wading
through persiflage and conversation. &quot;You
folks ain't <i>done</i> nothin' the last ten minutes
only stand there and gas. Is that actin'?
Maybe it's wrote in the book. What I want
to know is&mdash;is it actin'?&quot; Burgess sat suddenly
erect and his eyes glowed. Miss Masters
half rose to assume authority but he
restrained her.</p>

<p>&quot;You shut up and leave me be,&quot; Polonius
cried. &quot;Ain't I got a right to say good-bye
to my son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can say good-bye all right,&quot; Rosie
reminded her, &quot;without puttin' up that
game of talk. Give him a 'I'll be a sister
to you' on the cheek an' git through sometime
before to-morrow. Cut it, I tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>This &quot;off with his head&quot; attitude on the
President's part delighted Burgess. But the
caste enjoyed it less and when the ghost was
docked of a whole scene it grew rebellious.</p>

<p>&quot;If you give me any more of your lip,&quot;
said the princely stage manager, &quot;I'll trow
you out altogether. There's lots of people
wouldn't believe in ghosts anyway. Me
grandfather seen this play in Chermany and
he told me they didn't use the ghost at all.
Nothin' but a green light with a voice comin'
out of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I could be the voice, couldn't I?&quot;
the ghost argued; and it was at this point
that Miss Masters took charge of the meeting
and introduced Mr. Burgess.</p>

<p>&quot;Who has offered,&quot; she went on in spite
of his energetic pantomime of disclaimer,
&quot;to help us with our play.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's real sweet of you, Mr. Burgess,&quot;
said the President graciously.</p>

<p>&quot;Not at all&mdash;not at all,&quot; he answered.
&quot;It will be a pleasure, I assure you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You'll excuse me, I'm sure,&quot; the Secretary
broke in, &quot;if we go right on with our
woik while you're here. We're makin' our
own costoomes, as much as we can. That
was one reason us young ladies chose Hamlet.
It's a play what everyone wears skoits
in. It's easier for us and it ain't so embarrassing,
and I guess our folks will like it
better. You <i>have</i> to think of your folks
sometimes. Even if they are old-fashioned.
Miss Masters got us pictures of Mr. Marsden's
production an' every last one of the characters
has skoits on. Hamlet's ain't no
longer than a bathin' suit, but anyway it's
there. I don't think it's real refined, myself,
for young ladies to wear gents' suits on
the stage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And of course,&quot; a gentle-eyed little girl
looked up from her sewing to remark,&mdash;&quot;of
course this club ain't formed just for makin'
shirt waists. We've got a culture-an'-refinement
clause in the club constitution, so
we wouldn't want to do nothin' that wasn't
real refined.&quot;</p>

<br /><br /></div>

<p>&quot;I understand,&quot; said Burgess more at a
loss than a conversation had ever found him,
&quot;And what may I ask, is your part of the
play?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mamie Conners is too nervous,&quot; the lady
President explained &quot;to come right out and
act. She's 'A flourish of trumpets within
an' a voice without an' a lady of the court
an' a soldier an' a choir boy at the funeral.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Miss Conners,&quot; Burgess assured this
timid but versatile Hyacinth, &quot;that's only
stage fright, all great actresses suffer from
it at one time or another.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>During the weeks that followed, order
gradually gained sway in Denmark and Burgess
gained an interest and an occupation
more absorbing than he had found for many
years.</p>

<p>&quot;My dear Margaret,&quot; he was wont to
assure Miss Masters, when she remonstrated
with him upon his generosity, &quot;Why
shouldn't I order supper to be sent in for
them? and why shouldn't I ask them up to
the house for rehearsals? There's the big
music room going to waste and those lazy
beggars of servants with nothing to do, and
you saw yourself how it brightened up poor
old Aunt Priscilla. She likes it&mdash;they like
it&mdash;I like it&mdash;you ought to like it. And you
certainly can't object to my having taken
them <i>en masse</i> to see Marsden in the play.
By George! I'll drag him to theirs. We'll
show him an Ophelia! that Mary Conners
is a little genius.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is wonderful,&quot; agreed Miss Masters.
&quot;The grace of her! The dignity! What she
herself would call the culture-an'-refinement!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All my discovery. That tyrant of a
Rosie Rosenbaum had cast her as a quick
change, general utility woman. And in the
day-time you tell me she's a miserable little
shop-girl in a Grand Street rookery!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is what she used to be. But I
went to the shop a day or two ago to ask her
to come up to my house to rehearse with
the new Hamlet. I watched her for a few
moments before she noticed me. She was
Ophelia to the life. She conversed in blank
verse. She walked about with that little
queenly air you have taught her. She was
delicious, adorable. At first she said that
she could not rehearse that night, but I told
her you wished it and she came like a lamb.
I often wonder if I did a wise thing in introducing
them to you. Your sort of culture-an'-refinement'
may rather upset them when
the play is over and we all settle back to the
humdrum.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did a great kindness to me,&quot; said
he, &quot;and the best stroke of missionary work
you'll do in a dog's age. I'm going to work.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are not,&quot; she laughed.</p>

<p>&quot;I am. Shamed into it by the Lady
Hyacinths.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then perhaps the balance will be maintained.
If you turn them against labor they
will have turned you toward it.&quot;</p>

<p>But Miss Masters' fears were groundless:
the Lady Hyacinths though dedicated to a
flower of spring were old and wise in social
distinctions. The story of King Cophetua
and the Beggar Maid would have drawn only
a contemptuous &quot;cut it out&quot; from the lady
President. Every Hyacinth of them knew
her exact place in nature's garden&mdash;all except
Mary Conners&mdash;now Ophelia&mdash;and she
knew herself to be a foundling with no place
at all. The lonely woman who had adopted
her was now dead and Mary was quite alone
in her little two-room tenement, free to
dream and play Ophelia to her heart's content
and to an imaginary Hamlet who was
always Burgess. To her he was indeed,
&quot;The expectancy and rose of the fair state.&quot;
&quot;The glass of fashion and the mould of
form.&quot; He was &quot;her honoured lord&quot;&mdash;&quot;her
most dear lord.&quot; But in Monroe Street she
never deceived him. Never handed his letters
over to interfering relatives. She could
quite easily go mad and tuneful when she
knew that each rehearsal&mdash;each lesson taught
by him and so quickly learned by her&mdash;brought
the days when she would never see
him so close that she could almost feel their
emptiness.</p>

<p>It was well that she played to an idealized
Hamlet for the real Hamlets came and went
bewilderingly. One of Burgess's first triumphs
of tact had been to pry the part away
from the lady President and give it to the
sturdy Secretary. There followed two other
claimants to the throne in quick succession
and then the lot fell to Rebecca Einstein
and stayed there. Each change in the principal
role necessitated readjustment throughout
the cast and at every change the lady
President was persuaded not to over exert
herself.</p>

<p>And still Burgess in the seclusion of the
homeward bound hansom railed and swore.</p>

<p>&quot;I tell you, Margaret, that girl will ruin
us. All the rest are funny. Overwhelmingly,
incredibly funny! And pathetic!
Could anything be more pathetic! But that
awful President strikes a wrong note: Vulgarity.
Take her out of it and we'll have a
thing the like of which New York had never
seen, for Ophelia is a genius or I miss my
guess and all the rest are darlings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But we can't throw out the President of
the club. She must have a part. You have
moved her down from Hamlet to Laertes&mdash;to
the King&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I did,&quot; groaned Burgess. &quot;Will you
ever forget her rendering of the line, &quot;Now
I could do it, Pat,&quot; and then her storming
up to me to know &quot;Who Pat was anyway?&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; laughed Margaret, &quot;and then how
you moved her on to Guildenstern and now
you have got her down to Bernardo with
all her part cut out and nothing except that
opening line, &quot;Who's there?&quot; and the other:
&quot;'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed,
Francisco.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, and she ruins them. I've drilled
her and drilled her till my throat is sore and
still she says it straight through her nose
just as though she were delivering an order
of 'ham and' at her hash battery. Just the
same truculent 'Don't you dare to answer
back' attitude. She's impossible. She must
be removed.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Lady Hyacinths scattering
to their different homes discussed their mentor.
Ophelia and Horatio and Hamlet were
going through Clinton Street together.
Ophelia was still at Elsinore but Horatio
was approaching common ground again.</p>

<p>&quot;I suppose he's Miss Masters' steady,&quot;
said he to Hamlet. &quot;He wouldn't come
down here every other night just to help us
goils out.&quot;</p>

<p>But Ophelia was better informed. She
knew Miss Masters to be engaged to quite
another person.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I know,&quot; cried Horatio triumphantly.
&quot;He's stuck on Rosie Rosenbaum.
It's her brings him.&quot;</p>

<p>Ophelia said nothing, and Horatio having
experienced an inspiration, set about
strengthening it with proof.</p>

<p>&quot;It's Rosie sure enough. Ain't he learned
her about every part in the play? Don't he
keep takin' her off in corners an' goin' 'Who's
there, 'Tis now struck twelve' for about
an hour every night? I wouldn't have
nothin' to do with a feller that kept company
that way, but I s'pose it's the style
on Fifth Avenue. You know how I tell
you, Ham, in the play that there's lots of
things goin' on what you ain't on to. Well
it's so. None of you was on to Rosie an'
his nibs. You didn't ever guess it did you
'Pheleir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; admitted Ophelia. &quot;No, I never
did.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well it's so. You watch 'em. The style
in wives is changin'. Actresses is goin' out
an' the 'poor but honest workin' goil' is
comin' in. One of our salesladies has a book
about it. &quot;The Bowery Bride&quot; its name
is. All about a shop goil what married a
rich fellow and used to come back to the
store and take her old friends carriage ridin'.
If Rosie Rosenbaum tries it on me, I'll break
her face. If she comes round me,&quot; cried
the Prince's fellow student: &quot;with carriages
and a benevolent smile, I'll claw the smile
off of her if I have to take the skin with it!&quot;</p>

<p>When Horatio and Hamlet left her, she
wandered disconsolate, down to the river.
But no willow grows aslant that brook, no
flowers were there with which to weave fantastic
garlands.</p>

<p>&quot;I've gone crazy all right,&quot; said poor
Ophelia as she watched the lights of the great
bridge, &quot;but I don't drown myself until
Scene VII. And I'm goin' up to his house
to-morrow night to learn to act crazy. I
guess I don't need much learning.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The performance of Hamlet by the Lady
Hyacinths is still remembered by those who
saw it as the most bewildering entertainment
of their theatrical experience. The play had
been cut down to its absolute essentials and
the players, though drilled and coached in
their lines and business, had been left quite
free in the matters of interpretation and accent.
The result was so unique that the
daily press fell upon it with whoops of joy
and published portraits of and interviews
with the leading characters. People who
had thought that only ferries and docks lay
south of Twenty-third Street penetrated to
the heart of the great East Side and went
home again full of an altruism which lasted
three days. And on the last night of the
&quot;run&quot; of three nights, Jack Burgess brought
Albert Marsden to witness it. Other spectators
had always emerged dumb or inarticulate
from the ordeal but the great actor was
not one of them. He was blusterous and
garrulous and, to Burgess' amazement, not
at all amused.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is that girl who played Ophelia?
Is she an East Side working girl or one of
the mission people?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's a shop-girl,&quot; answered Burgess.
&quot;There's no good in your asking me to introduce
you to her for I won't. That's been
one of our rules from the beginning. We
don't want the children to be upset and
patronized.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who taught her to act?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I coached them all as you know,
but she never seemed to require any special
teaching. Pretty good, isn't she?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Pretty good! She is a genius&mdash;a wonder.
This is all rot about my not meeting her.
I am going to meet her and train her. I
suppose you have noticed that she is a beauty
too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But she's only a child,&quot; Burgess urged.
&quot;She's only eighteen. She couldn't stand
the life and the work and she couldn't stand
the people. You have no idea what high
ideals these girls have, and Mary Conners&mdash;that's
the girl's name&mdash;seems to be exceptional
even amongst them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Too good for us, eh?&quot; asked the actor.</p>

<p>&quot;Entirely too good,&quot; answered Burgess
steadily.</p>

<p>&quot;And do you feel justified in deciding her
future for her! In condemning her to an
obscure life in the slums instead of a successful
career on the stage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do not,&quot; answered Burgess, &quot;she must
decide that for herself. I'll ask her and let
you know.&quot;</p>

<p>To this end he sought Miss Masters. &quot;I
want you,&quot; said he, &quot;to ask Mary Conners
to tea with you to-morrow afternoon. It
will be Sunday so she can manage. And
then I want you to leave us alone. I have
something very serious to say to her.&quot;</p>

<p>Margaret looked at him and laughed.
&quot;Then you were right,&quot; said she, &quot;and I
was wrong; I had found a wife for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For absolute inane, insensate romanticism,&quot;
said he, &quot;I recommend you to the
recently engaged. You used to have some
sense. You were clever enough to refuse
me and now you go and forever ruin my
opinion of you by making a remark like
that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not romanticism at all,&quot; she maintained.
&quot;It is the best of common sense.
You will never be satisfied with anyone you
haven't trained and formed to suit your own
ideals. And you will never find such a
'quick study' as Mary.&quot;</p>

<p>It was the earliest peep of spring and Burgess
stopped on his way to Miss Masters'
house and bought a sheaf of white hyacinths
and pale maiden hair for the little Lady Hyacinth
who was waiting for him.</p>

<p>As soon as he was alone with her he
managed to distract her attention from
her flowers and to make her listen to Marsden's
message. He set the case before
her plainly. Without exaggeration and
without extenuation.</p>

<p>&quot;And we don't expect you,&quot; he ended,
&quot;to make up your mind at once. You must
consult your relatives and friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have no relatives,&quot; she answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Your friends then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think I have many. Some of
the girls in the club perhaps. The old book-keeper
in the store where I work, perhaps
Miss Masters.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you have me,&quot; he interrupted.
But she smiled at him and shook her head.
&quot;You were real kind about the play,&quot; said
she, &quot;but the play's all over now. I guess
you'd better tell your friend that I'll take
the position. I have been getting pretty
tired of work in the store and I'd like to try
this if he don't mind.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but you mustn't go into it like that,&quot;
Burgess protested, &quot;just for the want of
something better. Acting is an art&mdash;a great
art&mdash;you must be glad and proud.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll try it,&quot; she said without enthusiasm.
&quot;If you feel that way about it I'll
try it. It can't be worse than the store.
The store is just horrible. Oh! Mr. Burgess
you can't think what it is to be Ophelia in
the evening with princes loving you and then
to be a cashier in the day-time that any
fresh customer thinks he can get gay with.
Maybe if I was an actress I could be Ophelia
oftener. I'd do anything, Mr. Burgess, to
get away from the store.&quot;</p>

<p>Burgess did not answer immediately. Her
earnestness had rather overcome her and he
waited silently while she walked to the window,
surreptitiously pressed her handkerchief
against her eyes and conquered the
sobs that threatened to choke her. Burgess
watched her. The trimness of her figure,
the absolute neatness and propriety of her
dress, the poise and restraint of her manner.
Then she turned and he rose to meet her.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary,&quot; said he, &quot;you never in all the
time I've known you have failed to do what
I asked you. Will you do something for me
now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she answered simply.</p>

<p>&quot;Then sit down in that chair and take
this watch of mine in your hand and don't
say one single, solitary, lonely word for five
minutes. No matter what happens: no
matter what anyone says or does. Will you
promise?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she answered again.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then,&quot; he began, &quot;I know another
man who wants you&mdash;this stage idea is not
the only way out of the store. Remember
you're not to speak&mdash;this other man wants
to marry you.&quot;</p>

<p>A scarlet flush sprang to Mary's face and
slowly ebbed away again leaving her deadly
pale. She kept her word in letter but hardly
in spirit for she looked at him through tear-filled
eyes, and shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course you can't be expected to take
to the idea just at first,&quot; said he, as if she
had spoken, &quot;but I want you to think it over.
The man is a well-off, gentlemanly sort of
chap. Miles too old for you of course&mdash;for
you're not twenty and he's nearly forty&mdash;but
I think he would make you happy. I
know he'd try with all the strength that's
in him.&quot;</p>

<p>Blank incredulity was on Mary's face.
She glanced at the watch and up at him and
again she shook her head.</p>

<p>&quot;This man,&quot; Burgess went on, &quot;is a friend
of Miss Masters and it was through her that
he first heard of the Lady Hyacinths. He
was an idler then. A shiftless, worthless
loafer, but the Lady Hyacinths made a man
of him and he's gone out and got a job.&quot;</p>

<p>Comprehension overwhelming, overmastering,
flashed into Mary's eyes. But her
promise held her silent and in her chair.
Again it was as though she had spoken.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I see you understand&mdash;you probably
think of me as an old man past the time
of love and yet I love you.&quot;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Doubt thou the stars are fire;<br /></span>
<span>Doubt that the sun doth move;<br /></span>
<span>Doubt truth to be a liar;<br /></span>
<span>But never doubt I love.&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>&quot;That's all I have to offer you, sweetheart.
Just love and my life,&quot; and he in
turn went to the window and looked out into
the gathering dusk.</p>

<p>Mary sat absolutely still. She knew now
that she was dreaming. Just so the dream
had always run and when the five minutes
were past, she rose and went to him: a true
Ophelia, her arms all full of hyacinths.</p>

<p>&quot;My honored Lord,&quot; said she. He
turned, and the dream held.</p>

<h2><a name="THERES_DANGER_IN" id="THERES_DANGER_IN"></a>THERE'S DANGER IN NUMBERS</h2>


<p>The Pennsylvania Limited was approaching
Jersey City and the afternoon
was approaching three o'clock
when Mr. John Blake turned to Mrs. John
Blake, n&eacute;e Marjorie Underwood, a bride of
about three hours, and precipitated the first
discussion of their hitherto happy married
life.</p>

<p>&quot;Your Uncle Richard Underwood,&quot; said
he&mdash;the earlier discussions in the wedded
state are usually founded upon relations&mdash;&quot;is
as stupid as he is kind. It was very good
of him to arrange that I should meet old
Nicholson. Any young fellow in the country
would give his eyes for the chance. But to
make an appointment for a fellow at four
o'clock in the afternoon of his wedding day
is a thing of which no one, except your
Uncle Richard, would be capable. He might
have known that I couldn't go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you must go,&quot; urged the bride, &quot;it's
the chance of a lifetime. Besides which,&quot;
she added with a pretty little air of practicality,
&quot;we can't afford to throw away an
opportunity like this. We may never get
another one, and if you don't go how are you
to explain it to Uncle Richard when we dine
there to-morrow night?&mdash;you know we promised
to, when he was last at West Hills.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But what,&quot; suggested her husband&mdash;&quot;what
if, in grasping at the shadow, I lose
the reality? I'd rather lose twenty opportunities
than my only wife, and what's
to become of you while I go down to Broad
Street? Do you propose to sit in the
station?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I propose nothing of the kind,&quot; she
laughed. &quot;I shall go straight to the Ruissillard
and wait for you. Dick and Gladys
may be there already.&quot;</p>

<p>Although Mr. John Blake received this suggestion
with elaborate disfavor and disclaimer
it was clear to the pretty eyes of
Mrs. John Blake that he hailed it with
delight, and she was full of theories upon
marital co-operation and of eagerness to put
them into practice. None of her husband's
objections could daunt her, and before he
had adjusted himself to the situation he had
packed his wife into a hansom, given the
cabman careful instructions and a careless
tip, and was standing on the step admonishing
his bride:</p>

<p>&quot;Be sure to tell them that we must have
out-side rooms. Have the baggage sent up,
but don't touch it. If you open a trunk or
lift a tray before I arrive I shall instantly
send you home to your mother as incorrigible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very well,&quot; she agreed; &quot;I'll be good.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then, if Gladys is there&mdash;it's only an off-chance that they come
before to-morrow&mdash;get her to sit with you. But don't go wandering about
the hotel by yourself. And, above all, don't go out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goosie,&quot; said she, &quot;of course I shan't go
out. Where should I go?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And you're sure, sure, sure that you
don't mind?&quot; he asked for the dozenth time.</p>

<p>&quot;Goosie,&quot; said she again, &quot;I am quite,
quite sure of it. Now go or you will surely
miss your appointment and disappoint your
uncle.&quot;</p>

<p>After two or three more questions of his
and assurances of hers the cab was allowed
to swing out into the current. John had
given the driver careful navigation orders,
and Marjorie leaned back contentedly enough
and watched the busy people, all hot and
haggard, as New York's people sometimes
are in the first warm days of May. Her collection
of illustrated post-cards had prepared
her to identify many of the places she passed,
but once or twice she felt, a little ruefully
the difference between this, her actual first
glimpse of New York and the same first
glimpse as she and John had planned it
before the benign, but hardly felicitous,
interference of Uncle Richard. This feeling
of loneliness was strongly in the ascendent
when the cab stopped under an ornate
portico and two large male creatures, in
powdered wigs and white silk stockings,
emerged before her astonished eyes. Open
flew her little door, down jumped the cabman,
out rushed other menials and laid
hands upon her baggage. Horses fretted,
pedestrians risked their lives, motors snorted
and newsboys clamored as an enormous
police-appearing person assisted her to alight.
He had such an air of having been expecting
and longing for her arrival that she wondered
innocently whether John had telephoned
about her. This thought persisted with her
until she and her following of baggage-laden
pages drew up before the desk, but it fell
from her with a crash when she encountered
the aloof, impersonal, world-weary regard of
the presiding clerk. In all Marjorie's happy
life she had never met anything but welcome.
The belle of a fast-growing town is
rather a sheltered person, and not even the
most confiding of ing&eacute;nues could detect a
spark of greeting in the lackadaisical regard
of this highly-manicured young man.</p>

<p>Marjorie began her story, began to recite
her lesson: &quot;Outside rooms, not lower than
the fourth nor higher than the eighth floor;
the Fifth Avenue side if possible&mdash;and was
Mrs. Robert Blake in?&quot;</p>

<p>The lackadaisical young man consulted the
register with a disparaging eye.</p>

<p>&quot;Not staying here,&quot; Marjorie understood
him to remark.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, it doesn't matter&mdash;but about the
rooms?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Front!&quot; drawled the young man, and
several blue-clad bellboys ceased from lolling
on a bench and approached the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;Register here,&quot; commanded the clerk,
twirling the big book on its turn-table toward
Marjorie so suddenly that she jumped, and
laying his pink-tinted finger on its first blank
line.</p>

<p>&quot;No, thank you,&quot; she stammered, &quot;I was
not to register until my husband&mdash;&quot; and her
heart cried out within her for that she was
saying these new, dear words for the first
time to so unresponsive a stranger&mdash;&quot;told
me not to register until he should come and
see that the rooms were satisfactory. He
will be here presently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We have no unsatisfactory rooms,&quot; was
the answer, followed by: &quot;Front 625 and 6,&quot;
and fresh pages and bellboys fell upon the
yellow baggage, and Marjorie, in a hot confusion
of counting her property and wondering
how to resent the young man's impertinence,
turned to follow them.</p>

<p>&quot;One moment, madam,&quot; the clerk murmured;
&quot;name and address, please.&quot; The
pages were escaping with the bags, and Mrs.
Blake hardly turned as she answered, according
to the habit of her lifetime:</p>

<p>&quot;Underwood, West Hills, N.J.,&quot; and flew
to the elevator, which had already swallowed
her baggage and the boys. Up to suite
Number 625 and 6 she was conducted by her
blue-clad attendants, who opened the windows,
pushed the furniture about&mdash;then
waited; who fetched ice water, drew down
shades&mdash;and waited; who closed the windows,
drew up the shades, shifted the baggage
from sofa to armchair, unbuckled the
straps of a suitcase, indicated the telephone&mdash;and
waited; who put the bags on the bed,
opened the windows, pushed the furniture
back against the wall&mdash;and waited. Marjorie
viewed all these man&oelig;uvres with amused
but unsophisticated eyes. She smiled serenely
at the smiling bellboys&mdash;while they
waited. She thanked them prettily for their
assistance&mdash;and they waited. She dismissed
them still prettily, and it is to be regretted
that, in the privacy of the hall, they swore.</p>

<p>She then took possession of her little domain.
The clerk, however unbearably, had
spoken the truth, and the rooms were charming.
There could be no question, she decided,
of going farther. She spread her
pretty wedding silver on the dressing-table,
she hung her neglig&eacute;e with her hat and coat
in the closet. She went down on her knees
and investigated the slide which was to lead
shoes to the bootblack; she tested, with her
bridal glove-stretcher, the electrical device
in the bathroom for the heating of curling
irons. She studied all the pictures, drew out
all the drawers, examined the furniture and
bric-a-brac, and then she looked at her
watch. Only half an hour was gone.</p>

<p>She went to the window and watched
the hats of the passing multitude, noting
how short and fore-shortened all the figures
seemed and how queerly the horses passed
along beneath her, without visible legs to
move them. Still an hour before John could
be expected.</p>

<p>And then their trunks, hers large and his
small, made their thumping entrance. The
porter crossed to the window and raised the
shade, crossed to her trunk and undid its
straps, dried his moistened brow&mdash;and
waited. Marjorie thanked him and smiled.
He smiled and waited, drying his brow industriously
the while. No village black-smith
ever had so damp a brow as he. She
sympathized with him in the matter of the
heat; he agreed&mdash;and waited. He undid the
straps of John's trunk; he moved her trunk
into greater proximity to the window and the
light; he carried John's trunk into the sitting-room;
he performed innumerable feats of
prowess before her. But she only smiled
and commended in an unfinancial way. Finally
he laid violent hands upon his truck
and retreated into the hall, swearing, as
became his age, more luridly than the bellboys.</p>

<p>Once more Marjorie looked out into the
street for a while and began to plan the exact
form of greeting with which she should meet
John. It already seemed an eternity since
she had parted with him. She drew the
pretty evening dress which she had chosen
for this and most important evening from its
tissue-paper nest in the upper tray of her
trunk. Its daintiness comforted and cheered
her, as a friend's face might have done, and
under its impetus she found calm enough to
rearrange her hair, and, with many a shy
recoil and shy caress, to lay out John's evening
things for him, as she had often laid out
her father's. How surprised, she smiled, he
would be. How delighted, when he came, to
find everything so comfy and domestic.
Surely it was time for him to come. Presently
it was late, and yet he did not come.
She evolved another form of greeting: he
did not deserve comfort and domesticity
when he did not set more store on them than
on a stupid interview in a stuffy office. He
should see that an appointment with old
Nicholson could not be allowed to interfere
with their home life; that, simply because
they were married now, he could not neglect
her with impunity.</p>

<p>She practised the detached, casual sort of
smile with which she would greet him, and
the patient, uninterested silence with which
she would listen to his apologies. Then, realizing
that these histrionics would be somewhat
marred by a pink neglig&eacute;e, she struggled
into her dinner dress.</p>

<p>It was then seven o'clock and time to
practise some more vehement reception for
the laggard. It went well&mdash;very well. Any man
would have been annihilated by it, but there
was still no man when half-past seven came.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly she fell into a panic. John
was dead! She had heard and read of the
perils of New York. She had seen a hundred
potential accidents on her drive from the
ferry. Trolley, anarchist, elevated railroad,
collapsed buildings, frightened horses, runaway
automobiles. Her dear John! Her mangled husband! Passing out
of the world, even while she, his widowed
bride, was dressing in hideous colors, and
thinking so falsely of him!</p>

<p>He must be brought to her. Some one
should go and say something to somebody!
Telephone Uncle Richard! She flew to the
directory, which had interested her so little
when the polite bellboy of the itching palm
had pointed it out to her, and presently she
had startled a respectable old stockbroker, so
thoroughly and so hastily that he burst into
his wife's presence with the news that John
Blake had met with a frightful accident and
was being carried to the hotel in the automobile
of some rich gentleman from Paterson,
New Jersey.</p>

<p>&quot;Hurry down there at once,&quot; commanded
Aunt Richard, who was as staid and practical
as the wife of a stockbroker ought to be,
&quot;and bring the two poor lambs here in your
car. Take the big one. They'll want plenty
of room to lay him flat. I'll have the nurse
and the doctor here and a room ready. Get
there if possible before he does, so as not to
move him about too often.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. John Blake, bride now of
nearly eight hours, lay in a stricken heap
upon the bed, bedewing with hot tears the
shirt she had so dutifully laid ready for Mr.
John Blake, and which now he was never
more to wear. And Mr. John Blake, in a
hurricane of fear, exasperation and bewilderment,
a taxicab, and the swift-falling darkness,
fared from hotel to hotel and demanded
speech with Mrs. John Blake, a young lady
in blue with several handbags and some
heavy luggage, who had arrived at some
hotel early that afternoon.</p>

<p>His interview with old Nicholson had been
short and satisfactory, and at about five-thirty
o'clock he was at the Ruissillard inquiring
for Mrs. J. Blake's number and floor
with a confidence he was soon to lose. There
was no such person. No such name. Then
could the clerk tell him whether, and why,
she had gone elsewhere. A slim and tall
young lady in blue.</p>

<p>The clerk really couldn't say. He had
been on duty for only half an hour. There
was no person of the name of Blake in the
hotel. Sometimes guests who failed to find
just the accommodation they wanted went
over to the Blinheim, just across the avenue.
So the bridegroom set out upon his quest
and the clerk, less world-weary than his
predecessor, turned back to the telephone-girl.</p>

<p>Presently there approached the desk a
brisk, business-like person who asked a few
business-like questions and then registered
in a bold and flowing hand, &quot;Mr. and Mrs.
Robert Blake, Boston.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My husband,&quot; she announced, &quot;will be
here presently.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He was here ten minutes ago,&quot; said the
clerk, and added particulars.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that's all right,&quot; replied the slightly-puzzled
but quite unexcited lady; &quot;he'll be
back.&quot; And then, accompanied by bags and
suitcases, she vanished aloft.</p>

<p>&quot;Missed connections, somehow,&quot; commented
the clerk to the stenographer, and
gave himself to the contemplation of &quot;Past
Performances&quot; in the <i>Evening Telegram</i>, and
to ordinary routine of a hotel office for an
hour or so, when, to prove the wisdom of the
lady's calm, the excited Mr. John Blake
returned.</p>

<p>&quot;There must be some mistake,&quot; he began
darkly, &quot;I've been to every hotel&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lady came ten minutes after you left,&quot;
said the genial clerk. &quot;Front, show the
gentleman to 450.&quot; And, presently, John
was explaining his dilemma to Gladys, the
pretty wife of his cousin Bob. &quot;She is
somewhere in this hotel,&quot; he fumed, &quot;and
I'll find her if I have to search it room by
room.&quot;</p>

<p>The office was hardly quiet after the appearance
and disappearance of Mr. John
Blake, when the clerk and the telephone-girl
were again interrupted by an excited gentleman.
His white whiskers framed an anxious,
kindly face, his white waistcoat bound a true
and tender heart.</p>

<p>&quot;Has Mr. Blake arrived?&quot; he demanded
with some haste.</p>

<p>&quot;Just a minute ago,&quot; the clerk replied,
and was surprised at the disappointment his
answer caused.</p>

<p>&quot;I must see him,&quot; cried the old gentleman.
&quot;You needn't announce me. I'll go right
up. I'm his wife's uncle, and she telephoned
me to come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Front!&quot; called the clerk. &quot;This gentleman
to 450.&quot;</p>

<p>At the door of 450 he dismissed his guide
with suitable <i>largesse</i>, and softly entered the
room. It was brightly illuminated, and Uncle
Richard was able clearly to contemplate
his nephew of eight hours in animated converse
with a handsome woman in evening
dress.</p>

<p>&quot;I think, sir,&quot; said the woman, &quot;that
there is some mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I agree with you, madam,&quot; said Uncle
Richard, &quot;and I'm sorry for it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you are exactly the man to help
us,&quot; cried the nephew; &quot;we are in an awful
state.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I agree with you, sir,&quot; repeated Uncle
Richard.</p>

<p>&quot;You <i>must</i> know how to help us,&quot; urged
the nephew. &quot;I've lost Marjorie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So I should have inferred. But she had
already thrown herself away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's <i>lost</i>!&quot; stormed the bridegroom.
&quot;Don't you understand? Lost, lost, lost!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I rather think he misunderstands,&quot; the
handsome woman interrupted. &quot;You've not
told him, John, who I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are mistaken,&quot; replied Uncle Richard
with a horrible suavity; &quot;I understand
enough. That poor child telephoned to me
not twenty minutes ago that her husband
was injured, perhaps mortally, and implored
my help. I left my dinner to come to his
assistance and I find him&mdash;here&mdash;and thus.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty minutes ago?&quot; yelled John, leaping
upon his new relative and quite disregarding
that gentleman's last words. &quot;Where
was she? Did she tell you where to look for
her?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So, sir,&quot; stormed Uncle Richard, &quot;the
poor, deluded child has left you and turned
to her faithful old uncle! Allow me to say
that you're a blackguard, sir, and to wish
you good-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you dare to move,&quot; stormed John
Blake, &quot;until you tell me where my wife is,
I'll strangle you. Now listen to me. This
is Mrs. Bob Blake, wife of my cousin Robert.
She's an old friend of Marjorie's. We had a
half engagement to meet here this week.
Bob is due any minute, but Marjorie is lost.
There is only one record of a Blake in to-day's
register and that's this room and this lady&mdash;when
Marjorie left me at the ferry she was
coming here, straight. I've been to all the
possible hotels. She is nowhere. You say
she telephoned to you. From where?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She didn't say,&quot; answered Uncle Richard,
shame-facedly, and added still more dejectedly,
&quot;I didn't ask. She said in a letter her
aunt received this morning that she was
coming here. So I inferred that she was
here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then she is here,&quot; cried Gladys. &quot;It's
some stupid mistake in the office.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go down to that chap,&quot; John threatened,
&quot;and if he doesn't instantly produce
Marjorie I'll shoot him.&quot;</p>

</div>

<p>&quot;You'll do nothing of the sort,&quot; his uncle
contradicted, &quot;the child appealed to me and
I am the one to rescue her. I shall interview
the manager. I know him. You may come
with me if you like.&quot;</p>

<p>Down at the desk they accosted the still-courteous
clerk. Uncle Richard produced his
card, and, before he could ask for the manager
the clerk flicked a memorandum out of
one pigeon-hole, a key out of another, and
twirled the register on its turn-table almost
into the midst of the white waistcoat.</p>

<p>&quot;The lady has been expecting you for
hours, Mr. Underwood,&quot; said he. &quot;Looked
for you quite early in the afternoon, so the
maid says. Register here, please. Quite
hysterical, she is, they tell me, and the maid
was asking for the doctor&mdash;Front! 625!&quot;</p>

<p>Uncle Richard's face, as he met John's
eyes, was a study. The telephone-girl disentangled
the receiver from her pompadour
so that she might hear without hindrance the
speech which was bursting through the swelling
buttons of the white waistcoat and making
the white whiskers quiver.</p>

<p>&quot;I know nothing whatever about <i>any</i> lady
in <i>any</i> of your rooms,&quot; he roared, greatly to
the delight of the bellboys. &quot;I know nothing
about your Underwood woman, with her doctors
and her hysterics. I want to see the
manager.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If,&quot; said the telephone maiden, adjusting
her skirt at the hips and shaking her figure
into greater conformity with the ideal she had
set before it&mdash;&quot;If this gentleman is 2525
Gram., then the lady in 625 rang him up at
seven-thirty and held the wire seven minutes
talkin' to him and cryin' to beat Sousa's
band. All about her uncle she was talkin'.
I guess it was him, all right, all right. His
voice sounds sort of familiar to me when he
talks mad.&quot;</p>

<p>But John had neither eyes nor ears for
Uncle Richard's wrath. He snatched the
key and the paper upon which the supercilious
clerk had inscribed, at Marjorie's
embarrassed dictation, &quot;Mrs. Underwood,
West Hills, N.J. (husband to arrive later),
625 and 6,&quot; and, since love is keen, he jumped
to the right conclusion and the open elevator
without further delay.</p>

<p>An hour or so later the attention of the
clerk and the telephone-girl was again drawn
to the complicated Blakes. A party of four
sauntered out of the dining-room and approached
the desk.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll register now, I think,&quot; said John.
And when he had finished he turned to the
star-eyed girl behind him.</p>

<p>&quot;Look carefully at this, Marjorie,&quot; he
admonished. &quot;Mr. and Mrs. John Blake.
<i>You</i> are Mrs. John Blake. Do you think you
can remember that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't laugh at me,&quot; she pleaded, &quot;Gladys
says it was a most natural mistake, and so
does Bob. Don't you, Gladys and Bob?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;An almost inevitable mistake,&quot; they chorused
mendaciously, &quot;but,&quot; added Bob, &quot;a
rather disastrous mistake for your uncle to
explain to his wife, the doctor and the nurse.
He'll be able for it, though; I never saw so
game an old chap.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And I'll never do it again,&quot; she promised.
People never do when they've been married
a long, long time, and I feel as though I had
been married thousands and thousands of
years.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor, tired little girl,&quot; said John, &quot;you
have had a rather indifferent time of it. Say
good-night to Dick and Gladys. Come, my
dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But, Win,&quot; remonstrated the bride-elect,
&quot;I really don't think we <i>could</i>.
Wouldn't it look awfully strange? I
don't think I ever heard of its being done.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Neither did I,&quot; he agreed. &quot;And yet I
want you to do it. Look at it from my point
of view. I persuade John Mead to stop wandering
around the world and to take an
apartment with me here in New York. Then
I meet you. The inevitable happens and in
less than a year John is to be left desolate.
You know how eccentric he is, and how hard
it will be for him to get on with any other
companion&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said Patty, &quot;that he never will
find any one&mdash;but you&mdash;to put up with his
eccentricities.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then, as if abandoning him were not
bad enough, I go and maim the poor beggar:
blind him temporarily&mdash;permanently, if he is
not taken care of&mdash;and disfigure him beyond
all description. Honestly, Patty, you never
saw anything like him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know,&quot; said she, &quot;I know. A pair of
black eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Black!&quot; he cried, &quot;why, they're all the
colors of the rainbow and two more beside,
as the story-book says. All the way from
his hair to his mustache he is one lurid sunset.
I don't want to minimize this thing. It
has only one redeeming feature: he will be
a complete disguise. No amount of rice or
ribbon could counteract his sinister companionship.
No bridal suspicions could live
in the light of it. Doesn't that thought
help?&quot;.</p>

<p>The conversation wandered into personalities
and back again, as a conversation may
three days before a wedding, but Patty was
not entirely won over to Hawley's view of his
responsibility for having with unprecedented
dexterity and precision planted a smashing
&quot;right&quot; on the bridge of his friend's nose in
the course of an amicable &quot;bout.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the oculist chap says,&quot; Winthrop
urged, &quot;that he simply must not be allowed
to use his eyes. I'm the only one who takes
any interest in him or has any control over
him, and to abandon him now would be an
awful responsibility. Can't you see that,
dear? If we stay at home to take care of
him he will understand why we're doing it,
and he'd vanish. Do let me put him into a
motor mask and attach him to the procession.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course, Win,&quot; Patty answered,
&quot;of course we must have him if you feel so
strongly about it. It's a pity,&quot; she ended
mischievously, &quot;that he dislikes me so much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's because you dislike him. But
just wait till you know one another.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will,&quot; she answered with a spirit which
promised well for the future. &quot;I'll wait.&quot;</p>

<p>And Winthrop was so touched and gratified
by her complaisance that he had no alternative,
save to duplicate it, when the following
evening brought him this communication:</p>

<p>&quot;Kate Perry and I were playing golf this
morning. And, oh! Win, it seems just too
dreadful! I banged her between the eyes
with my driver. I can't think how I ever
did it. She's not fit to be seen. Awful!
worse than Mr. Mead can possibly be. She
can't stay here and she can't go home to
Washington.</p>

<p>&quot;So, now, if you will consent, we shall be
four instead of three. Let me take poor
Kate. She can wear a thick veil and sit in
behind with Mr. Mead, in his goggles, and
leave the front seats for us. They'll be company
for one another.&quot;</p>

<p>Winthrop questioned this final sentence.
A supercilious, spoiled beauty&mdash;a beauty now
doubly spoiled and presumedly bad tempered&mdash;was
hardly an ideal companion for
the misanthropic Mead.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The wedding took place in the morning
and the beginning of the honeymoon was
prosaic enough. Winthrop and Patty sat in
the front seat of the throbbing touring car,
while hysterical bridesmaids and vengeful
groomsmen showered the requisite quantities
of rice, confetti and old slippers upon them.</p>

<p>It was at the New York side of the ferry
that a shrouded female joined them, and it
was at the Hoboken side of the river that a
be-goggled young man was added unto her.
The bride rushed through the formula of
introduction: a readjustment of dress-suit
cases and miniature trunks was effected, and
the disguise which the bridegroom had predicted
was complete. The most romantic
onlooker would not have suspected them of
concealing a honeymoon about them.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o'clock when at last
they reached their destination, the little town
of Rapidan, in New Jersey, and stopped before
the Empress Hotel. Hawley had visited
Rapidan once before, as a member of his
college glee club, and he had recalled it instantly
when Mead's disfigurement made
sequestration imperative.</p>

<p>The motor sobbed itself to a standstill:
several children and dogs gathered to inspect
it, and then finding more interest and
novelty in Mead's mask turned their attention
to him.</p>

<p>The Empress had evidently been dethroned
for some years, and the hospitality she afforded
her guests was of an impoverished
sort. Hawley, approaching the desk to make
enquiries, was met by a clerk incredibly
arrayed, and the intelligence that the whole
house was theirs to choose, except for two
small rooms on the third floor occupied by
two gentlemen who &quot;traveled&quot; respectively
in sarsaparilla and molasses.</p>

<p>Hawley returned to his friends and repeated
this information.</p>

<p>&quot;How perfectly sweet of them,&quot; cried the
irresponsible bride. &quot;Oh! Win, we must
stay here and see them. Isn't it the dearest
sleepy hollow of a place?&quot;</p>

<p>Attended by the impressed and impressive
clerk, they made an inspection of the house.
Mr. and Mrs. Hawley settled upon a suite
just over the main entrance. Mead was established
across the hall. But Kate found a
wonderful panorama which could only be
seen from the rooms on the third floor, and
there, down a dreary length of oil-clothed
hall, she bestowed herself and her belongings.</p>

<p>&quot;For I must,&quot; she explained to Patty, &quot;I
simply <i>must</i> get out of this veil and breathe,
and I shouldn't dare to do it within reach of
that horribly supercilious friend of Winthrop's.
I'm going to plead headache or
something, and have my dinner sent up
here.&quot;</p>

<p>Mead, meanwhile, was unfolding similar
plans to Hawley. &quot;I should have joined
you,&quot; said he, &quot;if your wife's friend had been
a little less self-sufficient and unsympathetic.
Of course, I don't require any sympathy; but
I don't want ridicule either. So, while she is
of the party I'll have my meals in my room.
I can't act the 'Man in the Iron Mask' forever.
You just leave the ladies together
after dinner and come up here for a pipe
with me.&quot;</p>

<p>And when Mr. and Mrs. Hawley next encountered
one another and reported the
wishes of their friends, he suggested and she
rapturously agreed, that they should dine in
their horse-hair-covered sitting-room.</p>

<p>&quot;I have a reason, dear,&quot; she told him, &quot;for
not wishing to go to the dining-room for our
first meal together. I'll explain later.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your wishing it is enough,&quot; he answered
before the conversation sank to banalities.</p>

<p>And when these several intentions were
made clear to the conscientious clerk, he sent
for the police force of the town&mdash;it consisted
of a mild, little old man in a uniform and
helmet which might have belonged to some
mountainous member of the Broadway Squad
in its prime&mdash;and implored him to spend the
evening in the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;They're beginning to act up funny already,&quot;
the clerk imparted. &quot;This eatin' all
over the house don't seem just right to me.
What do they think the dining-room's for
anyway? Sam was up with the bag belonging
to the single fellow, and he says he's got
the worst looking pair of black eyes he ever
saw. Here, Sam, you come and tell Jimmie
what he looks like.&quot;</p>

<p>Sam, a middle-aged combination of porter,
bellboy, furnace-man, office assistant and
emergency barkeeper was but newly launched
upon his description of Mead's face, when the
chambermaid, who was also the waitress and
housekeeper, broke in upon them with the
intelligence that never in all her born days
<i>or</i> nights had she seen anything like the face
of the young lady on the third floor.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with her,&quot; said the
clerk suspiciously, with a look which warned
Jimmie to be at once a Bingham and a Sherlock
Holmes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, Horace,&quot; she answered tragically,
&quot;that girl has two of the most awful black
eyes. The whites of them is red and then
comes purple and green and yellow. I guess
they was meant to be blue.&quot;</p>

<p>This chromatic scale was too much for
Jimmie. He reeled where he sat and then,
the postman opportunely arriving, sent word
to Mrs. Jimmie that duty would keep him
from her all the night.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell her,&quot; he huskily charged his messenger,
&quot;that there is suspicious circumstances
going on in this house.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You bet there is,&quot; the clerk agreed. &quot;It
looks like a case of attempted murder to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Divorce, more likely,&quot; was Jimmie's professional
opinion, but he had scant time to
enlarge upon it before the waitress, outraged
to the point of tears, broke out of her domain.
She brought with her an atmosphere of long-dead
beefsteak, chops and onions, and she
shrilled for an answer to her question.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with 'em anyway?
Ain't the dining-room good enough for 'em
to eat in? It done all right for Judge Campbell's
funeral this afternoon, and I found a
real sweet wreath on that there whatnot in
the corner. The candles wasn't all burnt up
neither, an' I set out four of 'em on the four
corners. It looks elegant, an' them tube-roses
smells grand. An' when I told that
young lady what's got the use of her eyes
how glad I was they happened in when we
was so well fixed for decorations, she looked
awful funny. Most like she was cross-eyed.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They all seem to have eye-trouble,&quot; Jimmie
commented. &quot;Do you suppose they're
running away from one of these here blind
asylums.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lunatic asylum, most likely,&quot; the cheerful
clerk contributed.</p>

<p>When the other two guests ceased from
traveling in molasses and sarsaparilla and returned
to their quiet hostelry, all these surmises
had hardened into certainties, and were
imparted to them with a new maze of suspicion,
more dense, more deadly, and more
strictly in accordance with the principles laid
down in &quot;Dandy Dick, the Boy Detective.&quot;</p>

<p>Madeline, the waitress, reported further
particulars as she ministered to the creature-comforts
of the traveling gentlemen dining
alone among the funeral-baked meats. So
interested and excited did these gentlemen
become that they determined to interview,
or at least to see, their mysterious fellow
guests.</p>

<p>When their elaborate supper had reached
its apotheosis of stewed prunes and blue-boiled
rice, Hawley and Mead had gone out
for a meditative and tobacco-shrouded stroll.
They passed through the hall and inspiration
awoke in Jimmie.</p>

<p>&quot;By gum,&quot; said he, &quot;I know them now. I
suspicioned them from the first by what
Horace told me. But now I've got them
sure. You mind that time I was down to
New York and was showed over Police
Headquarters, by professional etiquette?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure,&quot; they all agreed. It was indeed a
reminiscence, the details of which had been
playing havoc with Rapidan's nerves for the
past fifteen years. They felt that they could
not bear it now.</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; continued Jimmie, gathering his
auditors close about him by the husky whisper
he now adopted, &quot;I see them two fellers
then. Mebbe 'twas in the Rogue's Gallery
and mebbe it was in the cells. I ain't worked
it down that fine yet, but I'll think and pray
on it and let you know when I get light.&quot;</p>

<p>When the staff and the commercial guests
of the Empress Hotel were waiting to see illumination
burst through the blue-shrouded
protector, the bridal party was veering momentarily
further from the normal. For the
deserted bride, alone in the desolate best
sitting-room, laid her head upon her arms and
laughed and laughed. She had made one
cautious descent to the ground floor in search
of diversion, and meeting Jimmie, she found
it. After a conversation strictly categorical
upon his side and widely misleading upon
hers, she had gone up stairs again and halted
in the upper hall just long enough to hear
Jimmie's triumphant:</p>

<p>&quot;Well, we know <i>her</i> name anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; hissed Horace, while the
porter relieved himself of a quid of tobacco
so that nothing should interfere with his hearing
and attention.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!&quot; ejaculated Jimmie, &quot;you bin a
hotel clerk two years and sold seegars all
that time (when you could) and you don't
know Ruby Mandeville when she stands
before you.&quot;</p>

<p>A box of the &quot;Flor de&quot; that gifted songstress,
was soon produced and pried open,
and the effulgent charms of its godmother
compared with the less effulgent, but no less
charming figure which had just trailed away.</p>

<p>&quot;It's her, sure as you're born,&quot; cried the
gentleman who traveled in molasses, absent-mindedly
abstracting three cigars and conveying
them surreptitiously to his coat
pocket.</p>

<p>&quot;She's fallen off some in flesh,&quot; commented
Horace, as with careful presence of
mind he drew out his daybook and entered
a charge for those three cigars.</p>

<p>&quot;But she don't fool me,&quot; said Jimmie,
&quot;she can put flesh on or she can take it
off&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My, how you talk!&quot; shrilled the chambermaid-bellboy,
&quot;you'd think you was talkin'
about clothes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It ain't no different to them,&quot; Jimmie
maintained. &quot;That's one of the things us
detekitives has got to watch out for.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What do you s'pose she's doing here?&quot;
asked the porter.</p>

<p>&quot;Gettin' married again most likely. That's
about all she does nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p>Patty was still chuckling and choking over
these remarks, when the door of the sitting-room
opened cautiously and Kate Perry,
swathed in her motor veil, looked in.</p>

<p>&quot;Are we alone?&quot; she demanded with
proper melodramatic accent.</p>

<p>&quot;We are,&quot; the bride answered, &quot;Winthrop
and Mr. Mead have gone out for a smoke.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I want you to tell me if I'm fading
at all. I've been looking at it upstairs, in a
little two-by-three mirror, and taken that
way, by inches, it looks awful. Tell me what
you think?&quot; She removed the veil and presented
her damaged face for her friend's inspection.
There was not much improvement
to report, but the always optimistic Patty
did what she could with it.</p>

alt="SHE SWOOPED UNDER THE LARGE CENTER TABLE, DRAGGING PATTY WITH HER." title="" /><br />
<span class="caption"><i>SHE SWOOPED UNDER THE LARGE CENTER TABLE, DRAGGING PATTY WITH HER.</i></span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>&quot;The left cheek,&quot; she pronounced, &quot;is
really better, less swollen, less&mdash;Oh! Kate,
here they come.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Perry began to readjust her charitable
gray chiffon veil. It was one of those which
are built around a circular aperture, and as
the steps in the hall came ever closer she,
in one last frantic effort succeeded in framing
the most lurid of her eyes in this opening.
Casting one last look into the mirror, she
swooped under the large center-table, dragging
Patty with her, and disposing their
various frills and ribbons under the long-hanging
tablecover.</p>

<p>&quot;If they don't find either of us,&quot; she whispered,
&quot;they'll go away to look for us.&quot;</p>

<p>She had no time to say more, and Patty
had no time to say anything before the door
opened and presented to their limited range
of vision, two utterly strange pairs of shoes
and the hems of alien trousers.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you will excuse me, Miss,&quot; began
the molasses gentleman, so full of his entrance
speech that he said the first part of it before
he noticed that the room was empty. And
then turned to rend his fellow adventurer,
who was laughing at him.</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't Horace tell us,&quot; he stormed, &quot;that
she was here, and wasn't you going to say
how you had saw her in the original 'Black
Crook?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I seen her all right,&quot; said his more grammatical
friend, with heavy emphasis.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you see her now?&quot; demanded the
irate molasses traveler.</p>

<p>&quot;I do not, but I'll set here 'til she comes.&quot;</p>

<p>They both sat. Not indeed until the arrival
of Ruby Mandeville, but until Hawley
and Mead made their appearance, and made
it, too, very plain that they had not expected
and did not enjoy the society of the
travelers.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are the ladies?&quot; asked Hawley.</p>

<p>&quot;Search us,&quot; responded the travelers.</p>

<p>&quot;They must have gone to their rooms,&quot;
said the bridegroom. &quot;If these gentlemen
don't object to our waiting here,&quot; he went on
with a fine and wasted sarcasm.</p>

<p>&quot;Set right down,&quot; said the genial sarsaparilla
man, and to further promote good
feeling he tendered his remaining &quot;Ruby
Mandeville&quot; cigar.</p>

<p>&quot;Your friend,&quot; said he affably, &quot;does he
always wear them goggles?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Always,&quot; answered Hawley. &quot;Eats in
them, sleeps in them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Born in them,&quot; supplemented Mead savagely.</p>

<p>They sat and waited for yet a few moments,
and though Mead did not add geniality
to the conversation, he certainly contributed
interest to it. For his views on honeymoon
etiquette being strong within him, and an
audience made to his hand, he went on to
amplify some of the theories with which he
had been trying to undermine Winthrop's
loyalty.</p>

<p>&quot;I am persuaded that most of the disappointments
of married life are due to the impossible
standards set up at the beginning.
Look at it this way. You know the fuss most
wives make about the hours a husband keeps.
Well! suppose Mr. Hawley comes out in the
car with me to-night. I know some fellows
who have a summer studio near here. We'll
run over and make a night of it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say,&quot; the molasses gentleman broke in,
&quot;be you married, mister?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No!&quot; said Mead.</p>

<p>&quot;Sounds like it,&quot; said the molasses gentleman.
&quot;Marriage will sort of straighten you
out on these here subjects.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, leave 'em be,&quot; admonished the sarsaparilla
man. &quot;If I had 'a met up with him
thirty years ago, mebbee I wouldn't be in
the traveling line now. He's got a fine
idee.&quot;</p>

<p>Hawley, meanwhile, was wrestling with
his manners and the &quot;Ruby Mandeville,&quot;
until the lady, as was her custom, triumphed.</p>

<p>He hurriedly and incompletely extinguished
the cigar, and attracted by the same opportunity
for concealment which had appealed to
Kate and Patty, he lifted a corner of the
heavy-fringed tablecover and sent Ruby to
join the other ladies.</p>

<p>Now, a lighted cigar applied suddenly to
the ear of an excited and half-hysterical conspirator,
will generally produce results. In
this case it produced a scream, the bride,
and after an interval, the shrouded confidential
friend.</p>

<p>&quot;See where amazement on your mother
sits,&quot; the ghost remarks in Hamlet, but
amazement never sat so hard on the wicked
Gertrude of Denmark as it did upon the four
men who saw the tablecloth give up its
ghosts.</p>

<p>At first there was silence. One of those
throbbing, abominable silences whose every
second makes a situation worse and explanation
more impossible.</p>

<p>The &quot;Black Crook&quot; speech of welcome
and appreciation died in the heart of the
molasses traveler. It did not somehow seem
the safest answer to Hawley's threatening&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;I think you gentlemen had better explain
how you happen to be in my private sitting-room.
Perhaps we had better step out into
the hall.&quot;</p>

<p>They did, and the echoes of their conversation
brought Jimmie, that trusty sleuth, upon
the scene. With him he brought Horace as
witness. Also, he carried his dark lantern.
He directed its glare fitfully at the two strangers
until Mead, catching a beam in his eye,
turned and drove Jimmie and his cohorts
from the scene. They retreated in exceedingly
bad order to the bar, and then Jimmie
announced in sepulchral whispers that he
had further identification to impart. He
required much liquid refreshment to nerve
him to speech, and his audience required to
be similarly strengthened to hear.</p>

<p>&quot;I've got 'em,&quot; he began, &quot;I know 'em
now. Horace, this is the biggest thing you'll
ever be anywhere near.&quot; And, as his hearers
drew close about him, he whispered &quot;counterfeiters.
The hull kit and bilin' of 'em.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Meanwhile, Kate and Patty wrestled afresh
with the automobile veil, and had succeeded
in getting it tied in a limp string around the
bridesmaid's neck, leaving all her head and
face uncovered. And when the groom and
the groomsman returned she, with a muffled
gurgle, dived back into the seclusion of the
tablecover.</p>

<p>&quot;We've got rid of those bounders,&quot; Hawley
announced, and&mdash;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello!&quot; cried Mead, &quot;Miss Perry gone
already?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She was very tired,&quot; said Patty veraciously,
but evasively.</p>

<p>&quot;Awfully jolly girl, isn't she Mead?&quot; said
Hawley, with the expansiveness of the newly-wed.
&quot;Handsome, too?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps she is, but so long as she dresses
like a veiled prophet it is hard to tell.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you two can get on without me,&quot; said
Patty, disregarding a muffled protest from
under the table, &quot;I'll go up and fetch,&quot; she
made these comforting words very clear,
&quot;my green motor veil.&quot;</p>

<p>Instantly, when he closed the door after
her, Mead turned to Hawley.</p>

<p>&quot;There's something wrong with this confounded
mask,&quot; said he. &quot;This strap-thing
that goes round my head must be too tight.
I've been mad with it the last half hour.
How do I look?&quot; he asked genially as he took
it off, and proceeded to tamper with the
buckles and elastic. &quot;Howling Jupiter!&quot;
he cried a moment later, &quot;I've busted
it.&quot;</p>

<p>As the two friends stood and stared at
one another aghast, they heard the click of
Patty's returning heels, and Mead, abandoning
dignity, courage&mdash;everything except the
broken mask&mdash;dived into Miss Perry's maiden
bower.</p>

<p>Mrs. Hawley watched this procedure with
wide and fascinated eyes. No ripple shook
the walls of the bower. No sound proceeded
from it as the moments flew. Then Patty
fell away into helpless laughter and wept
tears of shocked and sudden mirth into the
now useless motor veil.</p>

<p>&quot;Patty!&quot; remonstrated her husband, but
she laughed helplessly on. &quot;At least come
out into the hall and laugh there,&quot; he urged,
&quot;the poor chap will hear you.&quot; And when
he had followed her and listened to her shaken
whisper, he broke into such a shout as forced
the indignant and outraged Kate into a shudder
of protest and disgust.</p>

<p>Instantly Mead threw an arm past the
table's single central support and grasped a
handful of silk chiffon and two fingers.</p>

<p>He, being of an acquisitive turn, retained
the fingers. She being of a dictatorial turn,
rebuked him.</p>

<p>&quot;Finding is keeping,&quot; he shamelessly remarked.
&quot;Even in infancy I was taught
that.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, a certain pomp of scene and circumstance
is necessary to the sort of dignified
snubbing with which Miss Perry was accustomed
to treat possible admirers. Also, a
serene consciousness of superlative good looks.
But Kate Perry disfigured, cramped into a
ridiculous hiding place, and suffering untold
miseries of headache and throbbing eyes, was
a very different creature.</p>

<p>And Mead, flippant, hard, and misanthropic
in the state of nature, softened wonderfully
as he sat in the gloom of the tablecover, in
silent possession of those two slim fingers.</p>

<p>His words grew gentle, his manner kind,
and her answers were calculated to petrify
her long-suffering family if they could have
overheard them.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Mead,&quot; she said at last, &quot;will you
be so very kind as to stay here quietly under
the table while I scramble out and go up to
my room?&quot;</p>

<p>No tongue of angel could have made a
more welcome suggestion. Mead uttered feeble
and polite proffers of escort, and silently
called down blessings upon the head he had
never seen. He had just allowed himself to
be dissuaded from knight errantry, when the
door opened and Jimmie flashed his dark
lantern about the brightly lighted room. He
then beckoned mysteriously to the still vigilant
Horace, who lurked in the hall.</p>

<p>&quot;Have you found them?&quot; whispered that
youth.</p>

<p>&quot;Not a trace of them,&quot; answered Jimmie
triumphantly. &quot;They ain't gone out. They
ain't in their rooms, and I'm studyin' how I
can round 'em up. They're the most suspicious
characters I ever see, Horace, and this
night's work may cost us our lives.&quot;</p>

<p>This disposition of his existence did not
seem to cheer Horace.</p>

<p>&quot;Counterfeiters,&quot; Jimmie went on, &quot;is the
desperatest kind of criminals there is. Still
we got to git 'em. I'll look round this room
just so as nothing won't escape us, and then
we'll go up to the next floor. It's good we
got two of them located in the bridal suite.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmie, with his prying dark lantern and
his prodding nightstick, soon reached the
space under the table, and the counterfeiters
secreted there.</p>

<p>&quot;I got 'em,&quot; he cried delightedly. &quot;Hi,
you. Come out of there and show yourselves.&quot;</p>

<p>They came. There was nothing else to do.</p>

<p>&quot;Moses's holy aunt,&quot; cried Jimmie, falling
back upon Horace, who promptly fell back
upon the sofa.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, you,&quot; said Mead. &quot;You get out of
this, both of you. Don't you know this is a
private sitting-room?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No settin'-room,&quot; said Jimmie, recovering
somewhat, &quot;is private to them as sets
under tables blackening one another's eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You ridiculous idiot,&quot; snorted Mead.
&quot;Do you dare to think that I hurt this
lady?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Lady? Ain't she your wife?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is <i>not</i>,&quot; snapped Kate.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why did you hit her?&quot; demanded
Jimmie. &quot;If she ain't your wife what did
you want to hit her for? An' anyway, she'd
ought to be. That's all I got to say.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The same idea occurred to Mr. and Mrs.
Hawley, crouched guiltily against their door
to hear their victims pass, for their amazed
ears caught these words&mdash;the first were
Kate's:</p>

<p>&quot;You must let me give you some of my
lotion.&quot;</p>

<p>And then came Mead's:</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be <i>most</i> grateful. It must be hot
stuff. You know you're hardly disfigured at
all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The saints forgive him,&quot; Patty gurgled.</p>

<p>Later on in the darkness, Jimmie's idea
visited Mead and was received with some
cordiality. And at some time later still, it
must have been presented to Miss Perry, for
the misanthropic Mead&mdash;no longer misanthropic&mdash;now
boasts a massive and handsome
wife whom he calls his Little Kitty.
But the idea was originally Jimmie's.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_CHRISTMAS_GUEST" id="THE_CHRISTMAS_GUEST"></a>THE CHRISTMAS GUEST</h2>


<p>On the day before Christmas eve John
Sedyard closed his desk, dismissed
his two clerks and his stenographer
two hours earlier than usual, and set out in
quest of adventure and a present for his sister
Edith. John Sedyard had a habit of
succeeding in all he set forth to do but the
complete and surprising success which attended
him in this quest was a notch above
even his high average.</p>

<p>Earlier in the month, his stenographer had
secured the annual pledges of his affection
for all the relatives, friends and dependants
to whom he was in the habit of giving presents:
all except his mother, his unmarried
sister, Edith, who still lived at home, and
his fianc&eacute;e, Mary Van Plank. The gifts for
these three, he had decided, must be of his
own choice and purchase. He had provided
for his mother and for Mary earlier in the
week. Neither excitement nor adventure
had attended upon the purchase of their
gifts. Something for the house or the table
was always the trick for elderly ladies who
presided over large establishments and gave
their whole souls to the managing of them.
He bought for his mother a set of colonial
silver candlesticks. For Mary, he bought a
comb of gold&mdash;all gold, like her own lovely
hair. The dark tortoise shell of the one she
wore always seemed an incongruous note in
her fair crown. But Edith was as yet unpresented,
and it was on her account that Mr.
Sedyard deserted his office and delighted his
subordinates at three o'clock in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Edith was much more difficult than
the other two had been. She was strong-minded,
much given to churchwork and committees.
Neither the home, as represented
by the candlesticks, nor self-adornment as
typified by the golden comb could be expected
to appeal to her communistic, altruistic
nature. And Sedyard, having experienced
two inspirations, could think of nothing
but combs and candlesticks. So he
threw himself into the current, which swept
along Broadway, trusting that some accident
would suggest a suitable offering.
Meanwhile, he revelled in the crowd, good-humored,
holiday-making, holly-decked, which
carried him uptown, past Wanamaker's
and Grace Church, swirled him across old
&quot;dead man's curve,&quot; and down the Fourteenth
Street side of Union Square. Here
the shops were smaller, not so overwhelming,
and here he was stopped by seeing a red
auction flag. Looking in over the heads of
the assembled crowd, he saw that the auctioneer
was holding up a feather-crowned hat
and addressing his audience after the manner
of his kind:</p>

<p>&quot;Buy a hat for your wife. A waste-paper
basket by night and a hat by day. Genuine
ostrich feathers growing on it. Becoming
to all styles of feminine beauty. What am
I bid on this sure tickler of the feminine
palate? Three dollars? Why, ladies and
gents, the dooty on it alone was twelve.
It's a Paris hat, ladies. Your sister, your
mother, your maiden aunt&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Sedyard hearkened, but absently, to the
fellow's words, but his problem was solved.
He would buy Edith something to look pretty
in. She was a pretty girl and in danger of
forgetting it. And she had been decent,
John reflected, awfully decent about Mary.
He knew that the <i>entente cordiale</i> which existed
between Mary and his mother was
largely due to Edith, and he knew, too, that
Edith, an authority on modern-housing and
model-living, surely but silently disapproved
of Mary's living alone in a three-roomed
studio and devoting her days to painting,
when there was so much rescue work to be
done in the world.</p>

<p>&quot;I get my uplift,&quot; Mary would explain
when Edith urged these things upon her,
&quot;from the elevator. Living on the eighth
floor, dear, I cannot but help seeing the
world from a very different angle.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, John reflected as he chuckled in
retrospect over such conversations, Edith
had certainly been awfully decent.</p>

<p>During these meditations several articles
of feminine apparel had come and gone under
the hammer. The crowd had decreased
somewhat and his position now commanded
a clear view of the auctioneer's platform,
and he realized that the fierce light of the
arc lamps beat down upon as charming a
costume as he had seen for many a day.
All of corn-flower blue it was, a chiffon gown,
a big chiffon muff and a plumed hat. Oh!
if he had been allowed to do such shopping
for Mary! how quickly he would have entered
into the lists of bidders! Mary's eyes
were just that heavenly shade of blue, but
Mary's pride was as great as her poverty,
and the time when he could shower his now
useless wealth upon her was not yet. And
then his loyal memory told him that Edith
was blue-eyed like all the Sedyards and he
knew that his sister's Christmas gifts stood
before him. He failed, however, to discern
in the bland presence of the lay figure, upon
which they were disposed to such advantage,
the companion of one of the most varied
adventures in his long career.</p>

<p>The chiffon finery was rather too much
for the Fourteenth Street audience. The
bidding languished. The auctioneer's pleadings
fell upon deaf ears. In vain his assistant,
a deft-fingered man with a beard, twirled
the waxen-faced figure to show the &quot;semi-princesse
back&quot; and the &quot;near-Empire
front.&quot; Corn-blue chiffon and panne velvet
are not much worn in Fourteenth Street.
The auctioneer grew desperate. &quot;Twenty-five
dollars,&quot; he repeated with such scorn
that the timid woman who had made the bid
wished herself at home and in bed. &quot;<i>Twenty-five</i>
dollars!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Throw in the girl, why don't you?&quot; suggested
a facetious youth, chiefly remarkable
for a nose, a necktie and a diamond ring.
&quot;She's a peach all right, all right. She's
got a smile that won't come off.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right, I'll throw her in,&quot; cried the
desperate auctioneer. &quot;What am I bid for
this here afternoon costume complete with
lady.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty-seven fifty,&quot; said a woman whom
three years of banting would still have left
too fat to get into it.</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty-eight,&quot; whispered the first
bidder.</p>

<p>&quot;Thirty,&quot; said John Sedyard.</p>

<p>There was some other desultory bidding
but in a few moments Sedyard found himself
minus fifty-four dollars and plus a chiffon
gown and muff, a hat all drooping plumes
and a graceful female form, golden-haired,
bewitching, with a smile sweetly blended of
surprise, incipient idiocy and allure.</p>

<p>&quot;She's a queen all right, all right,&quot; the
sophisticated youth cheered him. &quot;Git onto
them lovely wax-like hands. Say, you know
honest, on the level, she's worth the whole
price of admission.&quot;</p>

<p>John, still chaperoned by this sagacious
and helpful youth, made his way to the
clerk's desk and proceeded to give his name
and address and request that his purchases
should be delivered in the morning.</p>

<p>&quot;Deliver nothin',&quot; said the clerk pleasantly.
&quot;Do you suppose we'd 'a let you
have the goods at that price if we could 'a
stored 'em overnight? Our lease is up,&quot; he
continued consulting his Ingersoll watch,
&quot;in just fifteen minutes. In a quarter of
an hour we hand over the keys and what's
left of the fixtures to the landlord. He's
let the store for to-morrow to a Christmas-tree
ornaments merchant.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then I suppose I'll have to get an expressman.
Where is the nearest, do you
know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Expressman!&quot; exclaimed the sharp
youth. &quot;Well, I guess the nearest would
be about Three Hundred and Fifty-second
Street and <i>then</i> he'd have a load and a jag.
No, sir, it's the faithful cab for yours.
There's a row of cabs just on the edge of the
square. I could go over and get you a
hansom.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; said John, &quot;I wish you
would.&quot; But a glance at his languishing
companion made him add, &quot;I guess you had
better make it a four-wheeler. Hansom-riding
would be pretty cold for a lady without
a coat.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All right,&quot; said the sharp youth. &quot;You
bring her out on the sidewalk and I'll get the
hurry-up wagon. Say!&quot; he halted to suggest,
&quot;you know what you'll look like, don't
you?&mdash;riding around with that smile. When
the lights flush you, you'll look just like a
bridal party from Hoboken.&quot;</p>

<p>Leaving this word of comfort behind him,
he proceeded to imperil his life among trolley
cars and traffic, while John engaged the lady
and urged her to motion.</p>

<p>He discovered that, supported at the waistline,
she could be wheeled very nicely. He
forced the muff over her upraised right hand,
so that it somewhat concealed her face, and
through an aisle respectfully cleared by the
onlookers he led her to the open air. There
he propped her against the show-window
and turned in search of the cab and his new
friend. In doing so he came face to face with
an old one.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, hello John!&quot; said Frederick Trevor,
a man who had an office in his building
and an interest in his sister. &quot;Who
would have thought of meeting you
here?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Or you,&quot; retorted John. &quot;But since
you are here, you can help me in a little
difficulty.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not now, old chap,&quot; said Frederick,
&quot;I'm in a bit of a hurry. See you about it
to-morrow. Well, so long. Don't let me
keep you from your friend.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Friend!&quot; stormed John and then following
the directions of Trevor's eyes, he descried
a blue-clad, golden-haired young lady lolling
against the window, trying with a giant chiffon
muff to smother a fit of hilarious laughter.
One arched and smiling eye showed above
the muff and the whole figure was instinct
with Bacchanalian mirth. &quot;Why that's,&quot;
he began to explain, but young Trevor had
vanished into the crowd.</p>

<p>Presently the cab with the smart youth
inside drew up to the curb and Sedyard, with
a new self-consciousness, put his arm around
the blue figure and trundled her across the
sidewalk. The cabman threw his rug across
his horse's quarters and lumbered down to
assist at the embarkation of so fair a passenger.
The smart youth held the door encouragingly
open and John proceeded, with
much more strength than he had expected
to use, to heave the passenger aboard.</p>

<p>Even these preliminaries had attracted the
nucleus of a crowd and the smart youth grew
restive.</p>

<p>&quot;Aw, say Maudie,&quot; he urged when the
lady stuck rigid catty-cornerwise across the
cab with her blue feathers pressed against
the roof in one corner, and her bird-cage
skirt arrangement protruding beyond the
door-sill. &quot;Aw, say Maudie, set down, why
don't you, and take your Trilbys in. This
gent is going to take you carriage riding.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with her anyway,&quot;
demanded the cabman. &quot;Don't she know
how to set in a carriage?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, she doesn't, she's only a wax figure,&quot;
said John, &quot;but I bought her and now I'm
determined to take her home. She'd better
go up on the box with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What! her?&quot; demanded the outraged
Jehu. &quot;Say, what do you take me for anyway?
Do you suppose I ain't got no friends
just 'cause I drive a cab? Why! I wouldn't
drive up Broadway with them goo-goo eyes
settin' beside me, not for nothing you could
offer, I wouldn't.&quot;</p>

<p>By this time the crowd had reached very
respectable proportions although there was
nothing to see except the end of a blue gown
hanging out of the cab's open door. The
sharp youth, the cabman and John took turns
in trying to adjust the lady to her environment.
The rigidity and fragility of her arms
and head made this very difficult, and presently
there rolled upon the scene a policeman,
large, Irish and chivalrous. It took Patrolman
McDonogh but a second, but one glance
at the tableaux and one whisper from the
crowd to understand that a kidnapping
atrocity was in progress.</p>

<p>With wrath in his eye, he shouldered aside
Sedyard and the cabman, grabbed the smart
youth, whose turn at persuasion was then
on, and threw him into the face of the crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! but you're the villyans,&quot; he admonished
them, and then addressed the captive
maid in reassuring tones.</p>

<p>&quot;You're all right, Miss, now. You're no
longer defenceless in this wicked city. The
arrum of the law is around you,&quot; he cried,
encircling her waist with that substantial
member. &quot;You're safe at last, come here
to me out of that.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! noble, noble man,&quot; cried an emotional
woman in the crowd. &quot;If all officers
were like you!&quot;</p>

<p>Heartened by these words the noble, noble
man exerted the arm of the law and plucked
the maiden out of the cab amid great excitement
and applause. But above the general
murmur the shrill voice of the sharp
youth rent the air:</p>

<p>&quot;Fathead,&quot; he cried, &quot;you've broke her
neck. Can't you see how her head's goin'
round and round?&quot;</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<span class="caption"><i>THE CHANGELESS SMILE AND THE DROOPING PLUMES MADE THREE COMPLETE
REVOLUTIONS AND NESTLED CONFIDINGLY UPON THE SHOULDER OF THE LAW.</i></span><br /><br />
</div>

<p>At this the emotional woman dropped to
the sidewalk. &quot;Lady fainted here, officer,&quot;
cried a gentleman. But the noble, noble
officer had no time for faints, and the lady
was obliged to revive with only the assistance
of the cold stones and curiosity.</p>

<p>For the shrill voice had spoken truth.
Something had given away in Maudie's mysterious
anatomy; the fair head, the changeless
smile and the drooping plumes made
three complete revolutions and nestled confidingly
upon the shoulder of the Law.</p>

<p>&quot;Here, none o' that,&quot; yelled Patrolman
McDonogh quite reversing his earlier diagnosis
of the situation. &quot;None of your flim-flams,
if you please. You go quiet and
paceable with this gentleman. A little ride
in the air is what you need.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's right, officer,&quot; Sedyard interrupted.
&quot;That's how to talk to her. I
can't do a thing with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Brute!&quot; cried the emotional woman now
happily restored. &quot;It's officers like him that
disgraces the force.&quot;</p>

<p>Patrolman McDonogh turned to identify
this blasphemer and Maudie's head, deprived
of its support, made another revolution and
then dropped coyly to her left shoulder.
She looked so unspeakable in that attitude
that the cabman felt called upon to offer a
little professional advice:</p>

<p>&quot;She needs a checkrein,&quot; he declared, &quot;an'
she needs it bad,&quot; a remark which so incensed
Patrolman McDonogh that Sedyard
decided to explain:</p>

<p>&quot;Just disperse those people, will you,&quot;
said he, &quot;I want to talk to you.&quot;</p>

<p>The sharp youth relieved the officer of law
of his fair burden and posed her in a natural
attitude of waiting beside the cab. McDonogh
cleared the sidewalk and hearkened
to Sedyard's tale.</p>

<p>&quot;So you see,&quot; said John in conclusion,
&quot;what I'm up against. I really didn't want
the dummy when I bought it and you can bet
I'm tired of it now. What I wanted was the
clothes, and I guess the thing for me to do
is just to take them in the cab and leave the
figure here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What!&quot; thundered McDonogh. &quot;You're
going to leave a dummy without her clothes
here on my beat? Not if I see ye first, ye
ain't, and if ye try it on I'll run ye in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Say! I'll tell you what you want,&quot; piped
up the still buoyant, smart youth. &quot;You
need one of them open taxicabs.</p>

<p>&quot;He needs a hearse,&quot; corrected the disgruntled
cabman. &quot;Somethin' she can lay
down in comfortable an' take in the sights
through the windows.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, he needs a taxi. He can leave her
stand in the back all right, but I guess,&quot; he
warned John, &quot;you'll have to sit in with her
and hold her head on.&quot;</p>

<p>And thus it was that Maudie left the scene.
She left, too, the smart youth, the cabman
and the noble, noble officer. And as the
taxi bumped over the trolley tracks she,
despite all Sedyard's efforts, turned her head
and smiled out at them straight over her
near-princesse back.</p>

<p>&quot;Gee!&quot; said the smart youth, &quot;ain't she
the friendliest bunch of calico.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;This case,&quot; said the noble Patrolman
McDonogh with unpunctual inspiration,
&quot;had ought to be looked into by rights.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Chauffeur,&quot; said John Sedyard to the
shadowy form before him, &quot;just pick out the
darkest streets, will you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; answered the chauffeur looking
up into the bland smile and the outstretched
hand above him. &quot;I'll make it if
I can but if we get stopped, don't blame
me.&quot;</p>

<p>A year later, or so it seemed to John Sedyard,
the taxicab, panting with indignation
at the insults and interferences to which it
had been subjected, turned into Sedyard's
eminently respectable block and drew up
before his eminently handsome house.</p>

<p>He paid and propitiated the chauffeur,
took his lovely burden in his arms and staggered
up the steps with the half regretful
feeling of one who steps out of the country
of adventure back to prosaic things. He
found his latchkey, opened his door and drew
Maudie into the hall. And on the landing
half-way up the stairs stood his sister Edith,
evidently the bearer of some pleasant tidings.</p>

<p>Maudie's smile flashed up at her from
John's shoulder. Edith stared, stiffened,
and retraced her steps. John wheeled the
figure into the reception-room and thus addressed
it:</p>

<p>&quot;Listen to me, you dumbhead. You may
think this adventure is over. Well, so did
I, but I tell you now it's only just beginning.
If you are not mighty careful you will be
wrecking a home. So keep your mouth
shut,&quot; he charged her, &quot;and do nothing till
you hear from me!&quot;</p>

<p>Maudie smiled archly, coyly, confidentially,
and he went upstairs.</p>

<p>In the sitting-room, he found gathered together
his mother, his sister and Dick Van
Plank, Mary's young brother and a student
at Columbia. John was supported through
Edith's first remark and the look with which
she accompanied it by the memory of her
goodness to Mary and by the anticipation
of the fun which Maudie might be made to
provide.</p>

<p>&quot;I wish to say, John,&quot; she began, before
any one else had time to speak, &quot;that I've
said <i>nothing</i> to mother or Dick, and I think
it would be better if you didn't. I can
attend to the case if you leave it to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Like you,&quot; said John shortly. &quot;Who
told you she is a 'case.' Mother,&quot; he went
on addressing that gentle knitter by the fire,
&quot;I want you to come downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She shall do nothing of the kind!&quot; cried
Edith, and as Mrs. Sedyard looked interrogatively
from one to another of her children,
her daughter swept on. &quot;John must be
crazy, I saw him come in with a&mdash;a person&mdash;who
never ought to be in a house like this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'd like to know why not?&quot; stormed
John. &quot;You don't know a thing about her.
<i>I</i> don't know much for that matter, but
when I came across her down on Union
Square, just turned out of a shop where she
had been working, mother, I made up my
mind that I would bring her right straight
home, and that Edith would be decent to
her. You can see that Edith does not intend
to be.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But my dear boy,&quot; faltered Mrs. Sedyard,
&quot;was not that a very reckless thing to
do? I know of an institution where you
could send her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! yes, yes,&quot; said John. &quot;And I suppose
I might have handed her over to a
policeman,&quot; he added, thinking of his attempt
in this direction, &quot;but I didn't. The
sight of her so gentle and uncomplaining in
that awful situation at this time of general
rejoicing was too much for me.&quot;</p>

<p>He felt this to be so fine a flight and its
effect upon Dick was so remarkable, that he
went on in a voice, as his mother always remembered,
&quot;that positively trembled at
times.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How was I, a man strong and well-dowered,
to pass heartlessly by like the Good
Samaritan&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's something wrong with that,&quot;
Dick interposed.</p>

<p>But John was not to be deflected. &quot;What,
mother, would you have thought of your son
if he left that beautiful figure&mdash;for she is
beautiful&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You don't say,&quot; said Dick.</p>

<p>&quot;To be buffeted by the waves of 'dead
man's curve?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, how awful!&quot; murmured the old lady.
&quot;How <i>perfectly</i> dreadful.&quot;</p>

<p>It was at this point that Dick Van Plank
unostentatiously left the room.</p>

<p>&quot;But I didn't do it, mother,&quot; cried John,
thumping his chest and anxious to make his
full effect before the return of an enlightened
and possibly enlightening Dick. &quot;No, I
thought of this big house, with only us three
in it, and I said 'I'll bring her home.' Edith
will love her. Edith will give her friendship,
advice, guidance. She will even give
her something to wear instead of the unsuitable
things she has on. And what do I
find?&quot; He paused and looked around dramatically
and warningly as Dick, with a
beautified grin, returned. &quot;Does Edith open
her heart to her? No. Does Edith open
her arms to her? No. All that Edith opens
to her is the door which leads&mdash;who can tell
where, whither?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can tell,&quot; said Dick, &quot;it leads
right straight to my little diggings.
If Edith throws her out, I'll take her
in.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, noble, noble man,&quot; ejaculated John
remembering the emotional woman, &quot;but
ah! that must not be. I took her hand in
mine&mdash;by the way, did I tell you, she has
beautiful little hands, not at all what I should
have expected.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You did not,&quot; said Dick. &quot;And now
that'll be about all from you. You're just
about through.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;My opinion is,&quot; said Edith darkly, &quot;that
you are both either crazy or worse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Go down and see her for yourself,&quot;
urged Dick, &quot;so quiet, so reserved&mdash;hush!
hark! she's coming up. Now be nice to her
whatever you feel! I'll be taking her away in
a minute or two.&quot;</p>

<p>But it was Mary Van Plank who came in.
Mary, all blooming and glowing from the
cold.</p>

<p>&quot;Who's that in the reception-room?&quot; she
asked when the greetings were over and she
was warming her slender hands before the
fire. &quot;She's the prettiest dear. She was
standing at the window and she smiled so
sweetly at me as I came up the steps.&quot;</p>

<p>John looked at Dick.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; admitted that unabashed delinquent,
&quot;I left her at the window when I
came up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Alas! poor child,&quot; sighed John, looking
out into the night. &quot;She'll be there soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is she going out for at this time?&quot;
Mary demanded. &quot;I quite thought that she,
too, had come to dinner. Who is she, Mrs.
Sedyard?&quot;</p>

<p>Upon her mother's helpless silence, Edith
broke in with the story as she felt she knew
it. Union Square, the discharged shopgirl,
John's quixotic conduct. And John watched
Mary with a lover's eye. He had not intended
that she should be involved. A moment
of her displeasure, even upon mistaken
grounds, was no part of his idea of a
joke.</p>

<p>But there was no displeasure in Mary's
lovely face.</p>

<p>&quot;Why, of course, he brought her home,&quot;
she echoed Edith's indignant peroration.
&quot;What else could he do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, for one thing he could have taken
her to the Margaret Louise Home, that
branch of the Y.W.C.A., on Sixteenth
Street, only a few blocks from where he
found her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Edith,&quot; Mary remonstrated. &quot;The
Maggie Lou! And you know they would not
admit her. Who would take a friendless girl
to any sort of an institution at this season?
John couldn't have done it! I think he's an
old dear to bring her right straight home.
Let's go down and talk to her. She must be
wondering why we all leave her so long
alone.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you don't,&quot; said Dick. &quot;Edith
didn't tell you the whole story. The girl,&quot;
and he drew himself up to a dignity based on
John's, &quot;is under <i>my</i> protection.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your protection!&quot; repeated his amazed
sister.</p>

<p>&quot;Precisely. <i>My</i> protection. Edith declines
to receive this helpless child. Therefore,
I have offered her the shelter of my
roof.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;His roof,&quot; explained Mary to Mrs. Sedyard,
&quot;is the floor of the hall bedroom above
his. It measures about nine by six. So the
thing to do, since of course, Dick is only
talking nonsense, is to let me take the girl
around to the studio until John and I can
plan an uninstitutional future for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You may do just as you please,&quot; said
Edith coldly. &quot;I have given my opinion as
to what should be done with her. It has
been considered, by persons more experienced
than you, the opinion of an expert.
Girls of her history and standards are not
desirable inmates for well-ordered homes.
I shall have nothing to do with her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How about it, Mary?&quot; asked her brother.
&quot;Are you willing to risk her in the high-art
atmosphere of the studio?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad to,&quot; Mary answered. &quot;It's
not often that one gets a chance of being a
little useful, and doesn't the Christmas Carol
say, 'Good will to men.' I'm going down to
see her now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a darling,&quot; cried John. &quot;True
blue right through. Now, we'll all go down
and arrange the transfer. But, first, I want
to give Edith one more chance. Do you
finally and unreservedly&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I do,&quot; said Edith promptly.</p>

<p>&quot;And you, Mary, are you sure of yourself?
Suppose that, when you see her, you
change your mind?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I've given my word,&quot;, she answered.
&quot;I promise to take her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's all I want,&quot; said John.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;How could you, John? How could you?&quot;
sobbed Edith. &quot;How could you tell
us&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you nothing but the absolute
truth. I meant her to be your Christmas
present, but you have resigned her 'with all
her works and all her pomps' to Mary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! but if I refuse to take her from
Edith?&quot; Mary suggested.</p>

<p>&quot;Then I get her,&quot; answered Dick blithely,
&quot;and she'd be safer with me. I know what
you two girls are thinking of. You are going
to borrow her clothes and make a Cinderella
of her. They are what you care about.
But I love her for herself, her useless hands,
her golden hair, her lovely smile&mdash;well, no,
I guess we'll cut out the smile,&quot; he corrected
when Maudie, agitated by the appraising
hands of the two girls, swung her head completely
round and beamed impartially upon
the whole assembly. &quot;It don't look just
sincere to me.&quot;</p>

<p>But there was no insincerity about Maudie.
She was just as sweet-tempered as she looked.
Uncomplainingly, she allowed herself to be
despoiled of her finery and wrapped in a
sheet while Mary wriggled ecstatically in
the heavenly blue dress, pinned the plumed
hat on her own bright head and threw the
muff into a corner of the darkened drawing-room
when she found that it interfered with
the free expression of her gratitude to John.</p>

<p>And some months later when the trousseau
was in progress, the once despised
Christmas guest, now a member in good-standing
of Mary's household, did tireless
service, smilingly, in the sewing-room.</p>

<p>&quot;Lemon, I think,&quot; said Miss Knowles, in
defiance of the knowledge, born of
many afternoons, that he preferred
cream. She took a keen and mischievous
pleasure in annoying this hot-tempered young
man, and she generally succeeded. But to-day
he was not to be diverted from the purpose
which, at the very moment of his entrance,
she had divined.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, thank you,&quot; he answered. &quot;I'll
not have any tea. I came in only for a
moment to tell you that I'm going to be
married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again?&quot; she asked calmly, as though he
had predicted a slight fall of snow. But
her calm did not communicate itself to him.</p>

<p>&quot;Again?&quot; he repeated hotly. &quot;What do
you mean by 'again?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now, Jimmie,&quot; she remonstrated, as she
settled herself more comfortably among her
pillows and centered all her apparent attention
upon a fragile cup and a small but
troublesome sandwich, &quot;don't be savage. I
only mean that you always tell me so when
you find an opportunity. That you even
manufacture opportunities&mdash;some of them
out of most unlikely material. A chance
meeting in a cross-town car; an especially
<i>forte</i> place in an opera; the moment when a
bishop is saying grace or a host telling his
favorite story. And yet you expect me to
be surprised to hear it now! Here in my own
deserted drawing-room with the fire lighted
and the lamps turned low. You forget that
one is allowed to remember.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You allow yourself to forget when you
choose and to remember when you wish:
You are&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And to whom are you going to be
married? To the same girl? Do you
know, I think she is not worthy of you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is not,&quot; he acquiesced, and she, for
a passing moment, seemed disconcerted.
&quot;Yet she is,&quot; he continued, cheered by this
slight triumph, &quot;the most persistent, industrious
and deserving of all the young persons
who, attracted by my great position and vast
wealth, are pressing themselves or being
pressed by designing relatives upon my
notice.&quot;</p>

<p>His hostess laughed softly.</p>

<p>&quot;Make allowances for them,&quot; she pleaded.
&quot;You know very few men can rival your
advantages. The sixth son of a retired yet
respectable stock broker, and an income of
four thousand a year derived from a small but
increasing&mdash;shall we say increasing&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Diminishing; incredible as it may seem,
diminishing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;From a small but diminishing law practice.
And with these you must mention
your greatest charm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which is?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your humility, your modesty, your lack
of self-assertiveness. Do you think she
recognizes that? It is so difficult to fully
appreciate your humility.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmie grinned. &quot;She's up to it,&quot; said
he. &quot;She knows all about it. She's as
clever, as keen, as clear-sighted.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is she, perhaps, pleasing to the eye?&quot;
asked Miss Knowles idly. &quot;Clever women
are often so&mdash;well, so&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmie gazed at her across the little tea-table.
He filled his eyes with her. And,
since his heart was in his eyes, he filled that,
too. After a moment he made solemn
answer:</p>

<p>&quot;She is the most beautiful woman God
ever made.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, now,&quot; said Miss Knowles, returning
her cup to its fellows and turning her face,
and her mind, more entirely to him, &quot;now we
grow interesting. Describe her to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again?&quot; Jimmie plagiarized.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, again. Tell me, what is she like?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She is like,&quot; he began so deliberately
that his hostess, leaning forward, hung upon
his words, &quot;she is exactly like&mdash;nothing.&quot;
The hostess sat back. &quot;There was never
anything in the least like her. To begin
with, she is fair and young and slim. She
is tall enough, and small enough and her
eyes are gray and black and blue.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She sounds disreputable, your paragon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And her eyes,&quot; he insisted, &quot;are gray in
the sunlight, blue in the lamplight, and black
by the light of the moon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And in the firelight?&quot;</p>

<p>He rose to kick the logs into a greater
brightness; and when he had studied her
glowing face until it glowed even more
brightly, he answered:</p>

<p>&quot;In the firelight they are&mdash;wonderful.
She has&mdash;did I tell you?&mdash;the whitest and
smallest of teeth.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They're so much worn this year,&quot; she
laughed, and wondered the while what evil
instinct tempted her to play this dangerous
game; why she could not refrain from peering
into the deeper places of his nature to see
if her image were still there and still supreme?
Why should she, almost involuntarily, work
to create and foster an emotion upon which
she set no store, which indeed, only amused
her in its milder manifestations and frightened
her when it grew intense? He showed
symptoms of unwelcome seriousness now,
but she would have none of it.</p>

<p>&quot;Go on,&quot; she urged. &quot;Unless you give
her a few more features she will be like little
Red Riding Hood's grandmother.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And she has,&quot; he proceeded obediently,
&quot;eyebrows and eyelashes&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One might have guessed them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;&mdash;beyond the common, long and dark and
soft. The rest of her face is the only possible
setting for her eyes. It is perfection.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And is she gentle, womanly, tender? Is
she, I so often wonder, good enough to you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She treats me hundreds of times better
than I deserve.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Doesn't she rather swindle you? Doesn't
she let you squander your time?&quot;&mdash;she
glanced at the clock&mdash;&quot;your substance?&quot;&mdash;she
bent to lay her cheek against the
violets at her breast&mdash;&quot;your affection upon
her&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And how could she be kinder? And when
I marry her&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And <i>if</i>,&quot; Miss Knowles amended.</p>

<p>&quot;There's no question about it,&quot; he retorted.
&quot;She knows that I shall marry
her.&quot; Miss Knowles looked unconvinced.
&quot;She knows that she will marry me.&quot; Miss
Knowles looked rebellious. &quot;She knows that
I shall never marry anyone else.&quot; Miss
Knowles took that apparently for granted.</p>

<p>&quot;Dear boy!&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;That I have waited seven years for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Poor boy!&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;That I shall wait seven more for her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Silly boy!&quot; said she.</p>

<p>&quot;And so I stopped this afternoon to tell
her that I'm coming home to marry her in
two or three months.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Coming home?&quot; she questioned with not
much interest. &quot;Where are you going?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To Japan on a little business trip. One
of the big houses wants to get some papers
and testimony and that sort of thing out of
a man who is living in a backwoods village
there for his health&mdash;and his liberty. None
of their own men can afford time to go. And
I got the chance, a very good one for me&mdash;but
I tire you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No; oh, no,&quot; said Miss Knowles politely.
&quot;You are very interesting.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then you shouldn't fidget and yawn.
You lay yourself open to misinterpretation.
To continue: a very great chance for me.
The firm is a big firm, the case is a big case,
and it will be a great thing for me to be heard
of in connection with it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Some nasty scandal, of course.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not exactly. It is the Drewitt case. I
wonder if you heard anything about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For three months after the thing happened,&quot;
she assured him with a flattering
accession of interest, &quot;I heard nothing about
anything else. Poor, dear father knew him,
to his cost, you know. I heard that there
was to be a new investigation and another
attempt at a settlement. And now you're
going to interview the man! And you're going
to Japan! Oh, the colossal luck of some
people! You will write to me&mdash;won't you?&mdash;as
soon as you see him, and tell me all about
him. How he looks, what he says, how he
justifies himself. O Jimmie, dear Jimmie,
you will surely write to me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Naturally,&quot; said Jimmie, and his thin,
young face looked happier than it had at
any other time since the beginning of this
conversation; happier than it had in many
preceding conversations with this very
unsatisfying but charming interlocutor. &quot;I
always do. Sometimes when your mood
has been particularly, well, unreceptive, I
have thought of going away so that I might
write to you. Perhaps I could write more
convincingly than I can talk.&quot; A cheering
condition of things for a lawyer, he reflected.</p>

<p>&quot;But this is a different and much more
particular thing,&quot; she insisted with a cruelty
of which her interest made her unconscious.
&quot;I have a sort of a right to know on account
of poor, dear father. I shall make a list of
questions and you will answer them fully,
won't you? Then I shall be the only woman
in New York to know the true inwardness
of the Drewitt affair. When do you start?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To-morrow morning. I shall be away
for perhaps three months, and then,&quot;
doggedly, &quot;then I'm coming home to be married.
I came in to tell you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And if I don't quite believe you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall postpone the ceremony. Shall we
say indefinitely, some time in the summer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not even then. Never, I think. That
troublesome girl is beginning&mdash;she feels that
she ought to tell you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That there is another 'another'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I fear so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Who will be in town for the next three
months?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Again, I fear so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then that's all right,&quot; said the optimistic
Jimmie. &quot;There never was a man&mdash;save
one, oh, lady mine&mdash;who could, for three
months, avoid boring you. When he holds
forth upon every subject under the sun and
stars you will think longingly of me and of
the endless variety of my one topic, 'I'm
going to marry you.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But if he should make it his?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I defy him to do it. There is no guise in
which he could clothe the idea which would
not remind you instantly of me. If he should
be poetical: well, so was I when we were
twenty-one. If he should give you gifts of
great price: well, so did I in those Halcyon
days when I had an allowance from my
Governor and toiled not. If his is an outdoor
wooing, you will inevitably remember
that I taught you to ride, to skate, to drive,
and to play golf. If he should attack you
musically, you will be surprised at the number
of operas we've heard together and of
duets we've sung together. And so, in the
words of my friend, fellow-sufferer, and name-sake,
Mr. Yellowplush, 'You'll still remember
Jeames.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's nonsense!&quot; cried Miss Knowles.
&quot;I've tried to be fond of you&mdash;I <i>am</i> fond of
you and accustomed to you. The fatal
point is that I am accustomed to you.
You say you never bore me. Well, you
don't. And that other men do. Well,
you're right. But people don't marry people
simply because they don't bore each
other.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Your meaning is clearer than your words
and much more correct. This really essential
consideration is, alas, frequently not
considered.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People should marry,&quot; said Miss Knowles
with a sort of consecrated earnestness&mdash;the
most deadly of all the practiced phases of
her coquetry&mdash;&quot;for love. Now, I'm not in
love with you. If I were, the very idea of
your going away would make me miserable.
And do I seem miserable? Am I lovelorn?
Look at me carefully and tell the truth.&quot;</p>

<p>Jimmie obeyed, and the contemplation of
his hostess seemed to depress him.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; he agreed gloomily, &quot;you seem to
bear up. No one, looking at your face, could
guess that your heart was in&mdash;was in&mdash;&quot;
Jimmie halted, vainly searching for the poetical
word. Miss Knowles supplied it.</p>

<p>&quot;In torn and bleeding fragments,&quot; she
supplemented. &quot;No, Jimmie, I'm sorry.
You've laid siege to it in every known
way, and yet there's not a feather out of
it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There are two ways,&quot; Jimmie pondered
audibly, &quot;in which I have not wooed you.
One is <i>&agrave; la</i> cave dweller. I might knock
you on the head with a knobby club and
drag you to my lair. But since my lair is
some blocks away, and since those blocks
are studded with the interested public and
the uninterested police, the cave dweller's
method will not serve. There remains one
other. I stand before you, so; I take your
hand, so; I may even have to kiss it, so.
And I say: 'Dear one, I want you. Every
hour of my life I want you. I want you to
take care of, to work for, to be proud of. I
want you to let me teach you what life
means. I want you for my dearest friend,
for my everlasting sweetheart, for my wife.'
And when I've said it, I kiss your hand, so;
gently, once again, and wait for your
answer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Dear boy,&quot; said she with an unsteady
little laugh, for&mdash;as always&mdash;she shrank from
his earnestness after she had deliberately
roused it, &quot;I wish you wouldn't talk like that.
You make me feel so shallow-pated and so
small. I don't want to talk about life and
knowledge and love. And I don't want any
husband at all. What makes you so tragic
this afternoon? You're spoiling our last hour
together. Come, be reasonable. Tell me
what you think of Drewitt. Why do you
suppose he did it? Did his wife and daughter
know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're quite sure about the other thing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unalterably sure. And, Jimmie, dear
old Jimmie, there are two things I want you
to do for me. The first is, to abandon forever
and forever this 'one topic' of which,
you are so proud. Will you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will not,&quot; said Jimmie.</p>

<p>&quot;And the second is: to fall in love with a
girl on the boat. There is always a girl on
a boat. Will you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I will,&quot; said Jimmie promptly. &quot;It
would be just what you deserve.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Miss Knowles bore the absence of her most
persistent and accustomed suitor with a
fortitude not predicted by that self-confident
young man. She danced and drove, lunched
and dined, rode and flirted with undiminished
zest, bringing, each day, new energy
and determination to the task of enjoying
herself.</p>

<p>The enjoyment of her neighbors seemed
less important. She preferred that her part
in the cotillion should be observed by a frieze
of unculled wall-flowers. A drive was always
pleasanter if it were preceded by a
skirmish with her mother in which Miss
Knowles should come off victorious with the
victoria, while Mrs. Knowles accepted the
<i>coup de gr&acirc;ce</i> and the coup&eacute;. A flirtation&mdash;if
her languid, seeming innocent monopoly
of a man's time and thoughts could be called
by so gross a name&mdash;was more satisfying if
it implied the breaking of vows and hearts
and the mad jealousy of some less gifted
sister; if it had, like a Russian folk song, a
sob and a wail running through it.</p>

<p>Jimmie had never approved of these
amusements and had never hesitated to express
his opinion of them in terms which were
intelligible even to her vanity. From the
days when they had played together in the
park she had dreaded his honesty and feared
his judgments. &quot;You're such a poacher,
Sylvia,&quot; he told her once, &quot;such an inveterate,
diabolical Fly-by-Night, Will-o'-the-Wisp
poacher. I sometimes think you'd
condescend to take a shot at me if you didn't
know that I'm fair game. But you like to
kill two birds with one stone; smash two
hearts with one smile.&quot;</p>

<p>During the weeks immediately following
the departure of her mentor she devoted herself
whole-heartedly to her favorite form of
sport. Besides her unscrupulousness she was
armed with her grandfather's name, the
riches of her dead father, her own beauty,
and a mind capable of much better things.
And, since Jimmie's presence would have
seriously interfered with the pleasures of
the chase, she was rather glad than otherwise
that he was not there to see&mdash;and
comment.</p>

<p>Her mother bore his absence with a like
stoicism. That astute matron had long and
silently deprecated the regularity with which
her Louis Quinze had groaned beneath one
hundred and eighty pounds of ineligibility,
the frequency with which a tall troup horse
of spectacular gait and snortings could be
descried beside her daughter's English hunter
in the park, the strange chain of coincidence
by which at theater, house party, dinner, or
even church, Jimmie smiling and unabashed,
would find his way to her daughter's side and
monopolize her daughter's attention.</p>

<p>In the excitement of the first stages of one
of her expeditions into another's territory,
Jimmie's first letter arrived. It was mailed
at Honolulu, and consisted obediently of
the cryptic statement: &quot;There is no girl on
the boat. She is a widow, but lots of fun.&quot;
And it changed the character of the invasion
from a harmless survey of the land to a determined
attack upon its fortresses. And so
Gilbert Stevenson, millionaire dock owner,
veteran of many seasons and more campaigns,
found himself engaged to Miss Sylvia
Knowles just when, after a long and careful
courtship, he had decided to bestow his hand
and name upon the daughter of the retired
senior partner of his firm: &quot;that dear little
girl of old Marvin's,&quot; as he described the
lady of his choice, &quot;his only child and a good
child, too.&quot; He bore his surprise and honors
with a courteous pomposity. Miss
Knowles bore the situation with restraint
and decorum. But that &quot;dear little girl of
old Marvin's&quot; could not bring herself to bear
it at all and wept away her modest claims
to prettiness and spirit in one desolate month.</p>

<p>Like many a humbler poacher, Sylvia
Knowles found an embarrassment in disposing
of her victims after she had bagged
them, and Mr. Gilbert Stevenson was peculiarly
difficult in this regard. She did not
want to keep him. In fact, the engagement
upon which she was enduring congratulations
had been as surprising to her as to her
fianc&eacute;. And the methodical manifestations
of his regard contrasted wearyingly with the
erratic events in another friendship in which
nothing was to be counted upon except the
unaccountable. So that when vanquished
suitors withdrew discomfited and returned
to renew an earlier allegiance or to swear a
new one; when &quot;that good child of old Marvin's&quot;
had withdrawn her pitiful little face
and her disappointment into the remote
fastness of settlement work; when her mother
resigned all claims upon the victoria and
loudly affirmed her preference for the brougham,
then things in general&mdash;and Mr. Stevenson
in particular&mdash;began to bore Miss
Knowles, and she began to look forward,
with an emotion which would have surprised
her betrothed, to foreign mails and
letters. She considerately spared Mr. Stevenson
this disquieting intelligence, having
found him in matters of honor and rectitude
as archaic and as fastidious as Jimmie himself.
&quot;Has a nasty suspicious mind,&quot; she
reflected, &quot;and a nasty jealous disposition.
I wonder if he will expect me to give up all
my friends when I marry him.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet even Mr. Stevenson could have found
no cause for jealousy in the matter of the
letters. He might have objected to their
being written at all, but beyond that they
were innocuous. For all the personality they
contained they might have been transcripts
of Jimmie's reports to his firm. He clung
doggedly to his prescribed topics, and he
could not have devised a surer method of
arousing the curiosity and the interest of
this spoiled young person. She spent hours,
which should have been devoted to the contemplation
of approaching bliss, in reading
between the prosaic lines, in searching for
sentiment in a catalogue of railway stations,
for tenderness in description of eccentric
<i>tables d'h&ocirc;te</i>. Finding no trace of his old
gallantry in all the closely written pages, she
attributed its absence to obedience and accepted
it as the higher tribute to her power.
She was forced to judge her lover's longing
by the quantity rather than by the ardor of
his words, and to detect the yearning of a
true lover's heart through such effectual
disguise as:</p>

<p>&quot;Drewitt is a fine old chap; as placid and
as bright as this country and a great deal
more so than anyone you'll see in the windows
of the Union League Club. He received
me so cordially that I felt awkward
about introducing the object of my visit,
but when I had admired everything in sight
from the mountains in the distance to the
rug I was sitting on, I finally faced the situation
and did it.</p>

<p>&quot;'Dear me,' said he, 'are those directors
still troubling themselves about their transaction
with me?' I admitted apologetically
that they were; that their books refused
to close over the gap left by the vanishing
of $50,000, and that he was earnestly
requested to return to New York and to lend
his acknowledged business acumen, etc., etc.
He never turned a hair. Said they&mdash;and I&mdash;were
very kind. Nothing could give him
greater pleasure. But the ladies preferred
Japan. Therefore he, etc., etc., etc. But
he would be delighted to explain the matter
fully to me; to supply me with all the figures
and information I desired. (And that, of
course, is as much as I am expected to bring
back.) But he would have to postpone his
return until&mdash;and you should have seen the
whimsical, quizzical old eye of his&mdash;until
the nations would agree upon new extradition
treaties. Then, of course, etc., etc., etc.
Meanwhile, as there was no immediate urgency
about the matter, as he hoped that I
would stay with them for as long a time as
I cared to arrange, he would suggest that we
should join Mrs. Drewitt in the garden.
She would welcome news of our American
friends. 'I need not ask you,' he added as
we went out through the wall-like people in
a dream or a fairy tale, to be discreet and
casual in your conversation with the ladies.
My daughter is away this week visiting an
old friend of hers who is married to a missionary
in a neighboring village. She knows
the reason for our being here. My wife does
not. It need not be discussed with either of
them.' I should think not!</p>

<p>&quot;And there in the garden was Mrs. Drewitt,
a fat little old lady in a flaming kimono
and spectacles. She wears her hair as your
Aunt Matilda does, stuck to her forehead in
scrolls. 'Water curls,' I think, is the technical
term. She was holding the head of a
dejected marigold while a native propped it
up with a stick. It seemed she remembered
my mother, and we spent a delightful tea-time
in a garden which was a part of the
same dream as the phantom wall. Then the
old gentleman led me off by myself and
wanted to hear all about Broadway.
Whether Oscar was still at the Waldorf.
Whether Fields and Weber made 'a good
thing of it' apart. Then the old lady led me
off by myself and wanted to know who was
now the pastor of the Brick Church, and what
was Maude Adam's latest play, and whether
skirts were worn long or short in the street.</p>

<p>&quot;'You see this dress,' she said, 'is not
really made for a woman of my age. In
fact, in this country all the bright and pretty
colors are worn by the waitresses. Geishas
they call them. But Mr. Drewitt always
liked bright colors, and red is very becoming
to me.' She was such a wistful, pathetic,
and incongruous little figure that I said something
about hoping that she would soon be
in New York again. 'But,' she said, 'Mr.
Drewitt cannot leave his work here. Didn't
you know that he is stationed here to report
the changes of the weather to Washington?
It is very important, and we can't go home
until he is recalled. And, besides,'&quot; she went
on with a half sob in her voice and a look in
her eyes that made her seem as young as her
own daughter, 'and, besides, I would much
rather be here. In New York my husband
was too busy. He had so many calls upon
his time, so many people to meet, and so
many places to go, that sometimes I hardly
felt as though he belonged to me. But now
for days and weeks at a time we are together.
And he has no business worries. And his
salary,' she brightened up to tell me, 'is
almost as good here as it used to be in the
Trust Company for <i>much</i> harder work.' She's
a sweet old thing&mdash;must have been quite a
beauty once&mdash;and I wish you could see old
Drewitt's manner with her&mdash;so courteous and
affectionate&mdash;and hers with him&mdash;so adoring
and confiding. It's wonderful!</p>

<p>&quot;It will take some time to get all the information
I want from the old man. He has
the papers and he is quite willing to explain
everything, but we spend the larger
part of every day in entertaining the old
lady and keeping her happy and unsuspicious.&quot;</p>

<p>A series of such letters covering several
placid weeks reduced Miss Knowles to a condition
of moodiness and abstraction which
all the resources at her command failed to
dissipate. In vain were the practical blandishments
of Mr. Stevenson; in vain her
mother's shopping triumphs; in vain were
dinners given in her honor and receptions at
which she reigned supreme. None of her
other experiments had resulted in an engagement&mdash;an
immunity which she now humbly
attributed to the watchful Jimmie&mdash;and she
was dismayed at the determined and matter-of-fact
way in which she was called upon to
fulfil her promise. &quot;If only Jimmie were at
home!&quot; she realized, &quot;he would save me.&quot;
This was when the happy day was yet a great
way off. &quot;If only Jimmie would come home,&quot;
she wailed as the weeks grew to months, and
even the comfort of his letters failed her.
For two months there had been no news of
him, and Fate&mdash;and Mr. Stevenson&mdash;were
very near when, at last, she heard from him
again. He sent a telegram nearly as brief
as his first letter.</p>

<p>&quot;I am coming home,&quot; it announced, &quot;I
am coming home, and I'm going to be
married.&quot;</p>

<p>And the simple little words, waited for so
long, remembered so clearly, and coming, at
last, so late, did what all Jimmie's more eloquent
pleadings had failed to do.</p>

<p>Sylvia Knowles, a creature made of vanities,
realized that she loved better than all
her other vanities her place in this one man's
regard. No contemplation of Mr. Stevenson's
estate on the Hudson, his shooting lodge on
a Scottish moor, his English abbey, and his
Italian villa could nerve her for the first
meeting with Jimmie, could fortify her against
his first laughing repetition:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>You</i> married to Gilbert Stevenson,&quot; or
his later scornful, &quot;You <i>married</i> to Gilbert
Stevenson.&quot;</p>

<p>So she dismissed Mr. Stevenson with as
little feeling as she had annexed him, and
sought comfort in the knowledge that her
mother was furious, her own fortune ample,
and that marrying for love was a graceful,
becoming pose and an unusual thing to do.</p>

<p>Her rejected suitor bore his disappointment
as correctly as he had borne his joy.
He stormed the special center of philanthropy
in which old Marvin's little girl had buried
herself, and she was most incorrectly but
refreshingly glad to see him. She destroyed
forever his poise and his pride in it when she
sat upon his unaccustomed knee, rested her
tired head upon his immaculate shirt front,
and wept for very happiness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>&quot;And I remember,&quot; said Miss Knowles,
&quot;that you always take cream.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing, thank you,&quot; Jimmie corrected.
&quot;Just plain unadulterated tea. I learned to
like it in Japan. But don't bother about it.
I haven't long to stay. I came in to tell
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That you're going to be married.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How did you guess?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You didn't leave me to guess. Your
telegram.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes!&quot; quoth Jimmie. &quot;I sent a
lot of them before I sailed. But in my
letters&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You mentioned absolutely nothing but
that stupid old Drewitt affair. Never a
word of the places you saw, the people you
met, or even the people you missed. Nothing
of the customs, the girls, the clothes.
Nothing but that shuffling old Drewitt and
his stuffy old wife. Nothing about yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Orders are orders,&quot; quoth Jimmie, &quot;and
those were yours to me. I remember exactly
how it came about. We had been talking
personalities. I have an idea that I made
rather a fool of myself, and that you told me
so. Then you, wisely conjecturing that I
might write as foolishly as I had talked, made
out a list of subjects for my letters. My
name, I noted with some care, was not upon
that list.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jimmie,&quot; said Miss Knowles, &quot;I was cruel
and heartless that day. I've thought about
it often.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You've thought!&quot; cried the genial Jimmie.
&quot;How had you time to think? Where were
all those 'anothers'?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There were none,&quot; lied Miss Knowles soulfully
with a disdainful backward glance toward
Mr. Stevenson. &quot;For a time I thought
there was one. But whenever I thought of
that last talk of ours&mdash;you remember it,
don't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Of course. I told you I was going to be
married as soon as I came home. Well, and
so I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So you are. But I used to think that if
you hesitated to tell me; if you felt that I
might still be hard about it and unsympathetic;
if you decided to confide no more
in me&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you would be sure to know.
Even if I had not telegraphed I never
could have kept it a secret from you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not easily. I should have been, as you
observe, sure to know. Do you remember
how I always refused to believe you? It was
not until you were in that horrid Japan,
where all the women are supposed to be
beautiful&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; Jimmie acquiesced. &quot;It was when
I was in Japan.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It was then that it began to seem possible
that you would be married when you came
home. It was then that I began to realize
that I didn't deserve to be told of your plans.
For I had been a fool, Jimmie. You had been
a fool, too, but not in the way you think.
And so, if you will sit where I sat that horrid
day, we will begin that conversation all over
again and end it differently. The first speech
was yours. Do you remember it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I'm going to be married,&quot; said Jimmie.</p>

<p>&quot;Good boy. He knows his lesson. And
now I say, 'To the most beautiful woman
in the world?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;To the most beautiful woman God ever
made. The dearest, the most clever, the
most simple.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Simple,&quot; repeated Miss Knowles with some
natural surprise. &quot;Did you say simple?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Simple and jolly and unaffected. As true
and as bright as the stars. And I'm going to
marry her&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Now this,&quot; Miss Knowles interjected, &quot;is
where the difference comes. You are to sit
quite still and listen to me because a thing
like this&mdash;however long and carefully one
had thought it out&mdash;is difficult in the
saying. So, I stand here before you where I
can look at you; for four months are long;
and where you may, when I have quite
finished, kiss my hand again; for again four
months are long. And I begin thus: Jimmie,
you are going to be married&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I told you first,&quot; cried Jimmie.</p>

<p>&quot;But I knew it first,&quot; she countered, &quot;to
a woman who has learned to love you during
the past three months, but who could not do
it more utterly, more perfectly, if she had
practiced through all the years that you and
I have been friends.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;So she says,&quot; Jimmie interrupted with
sudden heat. &quot;So she says. God bless her!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And, ah, <i>how</i> she is fond of you. 'Fond'
is a darling of a word. It keeps just enough
of its old 'foolish' meaning to be human.
Proud of you, glad of you, fond of you&mdash;I
think that this is, perhaps, the time for you
to kiss my hand.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a darling,&quot; he said as he obeyed.
&quot;But what I can't understand&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's not your turn. You may talk after
I finish if I leave anything for you to say.
See, I go on: You are going to marry&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The most beautiful woman in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That reminds me. What is she like? I've
not heard her described for ages.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because there was no one in New York
who could do justice to her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You are the knightliest of knights. Go
on. Describe her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she is neither very tall nor very
small. But the grace of her, the young, surpassing
grace of her, makes you know as soon
as your eyes have rested on her that her
height, whatever it chances to be, is the perfect
height for a woman. And then there is
the noble heart of her. What other daughter
would have buried herself, as she has done,
in a little mountain village&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles looked quickly about the
luxurious room, then out upon the busy
avenue, then back at him, suspecting raillery.
But he was staring straight through her;
straight into the land of visions. His eyes
never wavered when she moved slowly out
of their range and sat, huddled and white-faced,
in the corner of a big chair.</p>

<p>&quot;And all,&quot; Jimmie went on, &quot;so bravely,
so cheerily, that it makes one's throat ache
to see. And one's heart hot to see. Then
there is the beauty of her. Her hair is dark,
her eyes are dark, but her skin is the fairest
in the world.&quot;</p>

<p>Miss Knowles pushed back a loose lace cuff
and studied the arm it had hidden. <i>La reine
est morte</i>, she whispered, <i>morte, morte, morte</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;But what puzzles me,&quot;, said the genial
Jimmie, &quot;is your knowing about it all. I
never wrote you a word of it, and as for
Sylvia&mdash;by the way, did you know that her
name, like yours, is Sylvia?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; said Miss Knowles, &quot;I had even
guessed that her name would be Sylvia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a wonderful woman,&quot; Jimmie protested.
&quot;The most wonderful woman in the
world.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Except?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Except, of course, Sylvia Drewitt.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, yes,&quot; said Miss Knowles. &quot;Yes, of
course.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_SPIRIT_OF_CECELIA_ANNE" id="THE_SPIRIT_OF_CECELIA_ANNE"></a>THE SPIRIT OF CECELIA ANNE</h2>


<p>&quot;And all the rest and residue of my estate,&quot;
read the lawyer, his voice
growing more impressive as he
reached this most impressive clause, &quot;I give
and bequeath to my beloved granddaughter
and godchild Cecelia Anne Hawtry for her
own use and benefit forever.&quot;</p>

<p>The black-clothed relations whose faces
had been turned toward the front of the
long drawing-room now swung round toward
the back where a fair-haired little girl, her
hands spread guardian-wise round the new
black hat on her knees, lay asleep in her
father's arms. For old Mrs. Hawtry's &quot;beloved
granddaughter Cecelia Anne&quot; was not
yet too big to find solace in sleep when she
was tired and uninterested, being indeed but
nine years old and exceedingly small of
stature and babyish of habit. So she slept
on and missed hearing all the provisions
which were meant to protect her in the enjoyment
of her estate but which were equally
calculated to drive her guardian distracted.</p>

<p>&quot;I leave nothing to my beloved son, James
Hawtry,&quot; the document continued, &quot;because
I consider that he has quite enough
already. And I leave nothing to his son,
James Hawtry, Junior, the twin-brother of
Cecelia Anne Hawtry, because, though he
and I have met but seldom, I have formed
the opinion that he is capable of winning his
way in the world without any aid from
me.&quot;</p>

<p>James Hawtry, Junior, sitting beside the
heiress, failed to derive much satisfaction
from this clause. If things were being given
away, he was not quite certain as to what
&quot;rest and residue&quot; might mean, but if things
of any kind were being doled out he would
fain have enjoyed them with the rest.</p>

<p>Presently the lawyer read the final codicil
and gathered his papers together, then addressed
the blank and disappointed assemblage
with: &quot;As you have seen that all the
minor bequests are articles of a household
nature&mdash;portraits, tableware and the like,
'portable property' as my immortal colleague,
Mr. Wemmick, would have said&mdash;I
should suggest the present to be an admirable
time for their removal by the fortunate
legatees who may not again be in this neighbourhood.
And now I have but to congratulate
the young lady who has succeeded
to this property, a really handsome property
I may say, though the amount is not stated
nor even yet fully ascertained. If Miss Cecelia
Anne Hawtry is present, I should like
to pay my respects to her and to wish her all
happiness in her new inheritance. I have
never had the pleasure of meeting the principal
legatee. May I ask her to come forward
and accept my congratulations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Take her, Jimmie,&quot; commanded Mr.
Hawtry, setting Cecelia down upon her thin
little black legs, while he tried to smooth her
into presentable shape in anticipation of
the anxious cross-examination he was
sure to undergo when he returned with
the children to his New York home and
wife.</p>

<p>&quot;She looked as fit as paint,&quot; he afterward
assured that anxious questioner. &quot;I stood
the bow out on her hair and pushed her
dress down just as I've seen you do hundreds
of times. Jimmie helped, too, and I declare
to you, you'd have been as proud of those
two kids as I was when that boy led his little
sister through the hostile camp. Funny,
he felt the hostility instantly, though of
course, he didn't understand it. But she&mdash;well,
you know what a confiding little thing
she is, and having been asleep made her eyes
look even more babyish than they always do&mdash;walked
beside him, smiling her soft little
smile and looking about three inches high in
her little black dress.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If I had been there,&quot; interrupted Mrs.
Hawtry warmly, &quot;I should have murdered
your sister Elizabeth before I allowed her to
put that baby into mourning. The black
bow I packed for her hair would have been
quite enough.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, she had it on. I saw it bobbing up
the room while tenth and fifteenth cousins
seven or eight times removed, stared at it
and at her. But the person most surprised
was old Debrett when Jimmie introduced
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'This is her,' remarked your son with
more truth than polish, and I'm, well, antecedently
condemned, if that dry-as-dust old
lawyer didn't stoop and kiss her as he wished
her joy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, I'm glad he's as nice as that,&quot; said
Mrs. Hawtry, &quot;since he is to be your co-trustee.
However,&quot; she added a little wistfully,
&quot;I don't like the idea of anybody dictating
to us about the baby. It makes her
seem somehow not quite so much our very
own. And we could have taken care of her
quite well without your mother's money and
advice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, my dear,&quot; laughed her husband,
&quot;that's a novel attitude to adopt toward a
legacy. The baby is ours as much as she
ever was. The advice is as good as any I
ever read. And the money will leave us all
the more to devote to Jimmie. There's the
making of a good business man in Jimmie.&quot;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was part of what Mrs. Hawtry for a
long time considered the interference of
Cecelia Anne's grandmother that the child
should have a monthly allowance, small while
she was small and growing with her growth.
She was to be allowed to spend it without
supervision and to keep an account of it.
At the end of each year the trustees were to
examine these accounts and to judge from
them the trend of their ward's inclinations.
They would be then in a position to curb or
foster her leanings as their judgment should
dictate.</p>

<p>Now, Cecelia Anne, restored to her friends
from a wonderland sort of dream, called
going&mdash;West&mdash;with&mdash;papa&mdash;on&mdash;the&mdash;train&mdash;and&mdash;living&mdash;with&mdash;Aunt&mdash;Elizabeth,
was
too full of narration and too excited by the
envious regard of untraveled playmates to
trouble overmuch about that scene in the
long drawing-room which she had never
clearly understood. The first monthly payment
of her allowance failed to connect itself
in her mind with the journey. Her predominant
emotion on the subject of legacies
was one of ardent gratitude to Jimmie. He
had given her a quarter out of the change
they had received at the toyshop where they
had purchased the most beautiful sloop-yacht
they had ever seen or dreamed of. A
quarter for her very own; Jimmie's generosity
and condescension extended even further
than this. He also allowed her, the day
being warm, to carry the yacht for a considerable
part of their homeward journey,
and, when the treasure was exhibited upon
the topmost of their own front steps, he allowed
her twice to pull the sails up and down.
When he went to Central Park to sail the
<i>Jennie H</i>, that being as near the feminine
form of Jimmie Hawtry as their learning
carried them, James, Junior, frequently allowed
his sister to accompany him and his
envious fellows. Then it was her proud
privilege to watch the <i>Jennie H's</i> wavering
course and to rush around the margin of the
lake ready to &quot;stand by&quot; to receive her beloved
bowsprit wherever she should dock.
Then all proudly would she set the rudder
straight again and turn the <i>Jennie H</i> back
to the landing-stage where Jimmie, surrounded
by his cohorts, all calm and cool in
his magnificence, awaited this first evidence
of &quot;the trend of Cecelia Anne's inclinations.&quot;</p>

<p>Not quite a year elapsed before Mr. Hawtry's
genial co-trustee visited his little ward.
The reading of the will had taken place in
November, and on the last week of the following
June, Mr. Debrett, chancing to be in New
York, decided to cultivate the acquaintance
of Cecelia Anne. Mrs. Hawtry and the
twins were by this time settled in their
country home in Westchester, and Debrett,
driving up from the station in the evening
with Mr. Hawtry, found it difficult to accept
the freckled, barelegged, blue-jumpered
form which he saw in the garden, polishing
the spokes of a bicycle, as the ward who had
lived all these months in his memory: a
fragile little figure in funeral black. Never
had he seen so altered a child, he assured
Mrs. Hawtry with many congratulations.
She seemed taller, heavier, more self-assured.
But the smile with which she put a greasy
little hand into his extended hand was misty
and babyish still.</p>

<p>Presently, while the two men rested with
long chairs and long glasses and Mrs. Hawtry
ministered to them, Jimmie appeared
on the scene and after exchanging proper
greetings turned to inspect Cecelia Anne and
her work. &quot;I think you've got it bright
enough,&quot; he said with kindly condescension.
&quot;You can go and get dressed for dinner now.
And to-morrow morning if I'm not using the
wheel maybe I'll let you use it awhile.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, fank you!&quot; said Cecelia Anne who
had never quite outgrown her babyhood's
lisp, &quot;and can I have the saddle lowered so's
I can reach the pedals?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I s'pose so,&quot; said Jimmie grudgingly.
&quot;Sometimes you act just like a girl. You
give 'em something and they always want,
more. Now you run on and open the stable
door. I'm goin' to try if I can ride right
into the harness-room without getting off.
Don't catch your foot in the door and don't
get too near Dolly's hind legs.&quot;</p>

<p>When the children had vanished around
the corner of the house, Mrs. Hawtry turned
to Mr. Debrett.</p>

<p>&quot;There's the explanation of Cecelia Anne's
ruggedness,&quot; said she. &quot;She and Jimmie
are inseparable. He has taught her all kinds
of boys' accomplishments. And she's as
happy as a bird if she's only allowed to trot
around after him. It doesn't seem to make
her in the least ungentle or hoydenish and I
feel that she's safer with him than with the
gossipy little girls down at the hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not a doubt of it,&quot; Debrett heartily endorsed.
&quot;She couldn't have a better adviser.
Her grandmother, a very clever lady by the
way, had a high opinion of your son's practical
mind. A useful antidote, I should say,
to his sister's extreme gentleness.&quot;</p>

<p>He found further confirmation of old Mrs.
Hawtry's acumen when Mr. Hawtry proposed
that they should look over Cecelia
Anne's disbursement account, kept by herself,
as the will had specified.</p>

<p>Cecelia Anne was delighted with the idea.
Jimmie had wandered out to see about the
sports that were going to be held on the
Fourth of July, and so the burden of explanation
fell upon the little heiress. She drew
her account book from its drawer in her
father's desk, settled herself comfortably in
the hollow of his arm and proceeded to disclose
the &quot;trend of her inclinations&quot; as is
evidenced by her shopping list:</p>

<p>&quot;One sloop yat <i>Jennie H</i> swoped for
hockey skates when it got cold.</p>

<p>One air riffle.</p>

<p>Three Tickets.</p>

<p>One riding skirt.</p>

<p>Two Tickets.</p>

<p>Six white rats two died.</p>

<p>Four Tickets.</p>

<p>Leather Stocking Tales. Three Books.</p>

<p>Three Tickets.</p>

<p>Four Boxing Gloves.</p>

<p>Eight Tickets.</p>

<p>One bull tarrier dog and collar he fought
Len Fogerty's dog bit him all up and father
sent him away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I remember him,&quot; said Mr. Hawtry&quot;
&quot;a well-bred beast but a holy terror, go on
dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;One Byccle.</p>

<p>Three Tickets.</p>

<p>Stanley's Darkest Africa two books but
not very new.</p>

<p>One printing press.</p>

<p>Two Tickets.</p>

<p>Treasure Island. One Book.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And that's all the big things,&quot; finished
Cecelia Anne in evident relief. &quot;Jimmie
wrote down the prices, wouldn't you like to
see them?&quot;</p>

<p>And she crossed to Mr. Debrett and laid
the open book on his knee.</p>

<p>Mr. Debrett, as Cecelia Anne teetered up
and down on her heels and toes before him,
read the list again, counted up the total
expenditure and admitted that his ward had
got remarkably good value for her money.</p>

<p>&quot;But what are all these 'tickets,' my
dear?&quot; he asked her.</p>

<p>&quot;Eden Musee,&quot; answered Cecelia Anne.
And the very thought of it drew her to her
mother's knee. &quot;Jimmie and the boys used
to take me there Saturday afternoons in the
winter to try to get my nerve up. They
say,&quot; she admitted dolefully, &quot;that I haven't
got much. So they used to take me to the
Chamber of Horrors so's I'd get accustomed
to life. That's what Jimmie thought I
needed. They used to like it, and I expect
I'd have liked it, too, if I could have kept my
eyes open, but I never could. I couldn't
even <i>get</i> them open when the boys stood me
right close to that gentleman having death
throes on the ground after he'd been hung
on a tree. You can hear him breathing!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know him well,&quot; said Mr. Debrett.
&quot;He is rather awful I must admit. And
now we'll talk about the books. Don't you
care at all about 'Little Men' and 'Little
Women' or the 'Elsie Books?'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jimmie says,&quot; Cecelia Anne made reply,
&quot;that 'Darkest Africa' is better for me.
It tells me just where to hit an elephant to
give him the death throes. He says the
'Elsie Books' wouldn't be any help to us
even with a buffalo. We're going to buy
'The Wild Huntress, or Love in the Wilderness'
next month. Jimmie thinks that's
sure to get my nerve up&mdash;being about a
girl, you see&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And 'Treasure Island' now;&quot; said her
guardian, &quot;did you enjoy that? It came
rather late in my life, but I remember thinking
it a great book.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's great for nerve. Jimmie often reads
me parts of it after I go to bed at night.
There's a poem in it&mdash;he taught me that by
heart&mdash;and if I think to say it the last thing
before I go to sleep he says I'll get so's <i>nothing</i>
can scare me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Recite it for Mr. Debrett,&quot; urged Mrs.
Hawtry. And Cecelia Anne obediently began,
with a jerk of a curtsey and a shake of
her delicate embroideries and blue sash.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>&quot;Fifteen men on the dead man's chest<br /></span>
<span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!<br /></span>
<span>Drink and the devil had done for the rest<br /></span>
<span>Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!&quot;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Mr. Debrett's astonishment at this lullaby
held him silent for some seconds.</p>

<p>&quot;You see, sir,&quot; Cecelia Anne explained,
&quot;if you <i>can</i> go to sleep thinking about that
it shows your nerve. I can't. Not yet.
But it never makes me cry any more and
Jimmie says that's something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I should say it was!&quot; he congratulated
her. &quot;It's wonderful. And now in the
matter of dolls,&quot; he went on referring to the
list, &quot;no rag babies, eh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, but she has beautiful dolls, Mr. Debrett,&quot;
interposed her mother. &quot;She'll show
them to you to-morrow morning, won't you
honey-child? But she did not buy them.
They were given to her at Christmas and
other times. But really, since we came out
here for the summer they've been rather
neglected. Their mother has been so busy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And Jimmie made me a house for them!&quot;
Cecelia Anne broke in. &quot;And furniture!
And a front yard stuck right on to the piazza!
But I don't know, mother, whether I'd have
time to show them to Mr. Debrett in the
morning. I'm pretty busy now. It's getting
so near the race. And I pace Jimmie
<i>every</i> morning.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! that reminds me,&quot; said her father,
&quot;Jimmie told me to send you to bed at eight
o'clock&mdash;one of the rules of 'training', you
know&mdash;so say good night to us all and put
your little book back in the drawer. You've
kept it very nicely. I am sure Mr. Debrett
agrees with me.&quot;</p>

<p>When the elders were alone, Mrs. Hawtry
crossed over into the light and addressed
her guest.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't have you thinking badly of Jimmie,&quot;
she began, &quot;or of us, for allowing
him to practically spend the baby's income.
Every one of the things on that list mark a
stage in Cecelia Anne's progress away from
priggishness and toward health. I don't
know just how much she realizes her own
power of veto in these purchases but I am
sure she would never exercise it against
Jimmie. She's absolutely wrapped up in
him and he's wonderfully good and patient
with her. Of course, you know, they're
twins although no one ever guesses it.
They've shared everything from the very
first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In this combination,&quot; laughed Debrett,
&quot;the boy is 'father to the girl' and the girl
is 'mother to the boy.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Precisely so,&quot; Mr. Hawtry replied, &quot;and
the mother part comes out strong in this
race and training affair. An old chap down
at the hotel&mdash;one of those old white-whiskered
'Foxey Grandpas' that no summer
resort should be without&mdash;has arranged a
great race for his friends, the children, on
Fourth of July morning. The prize is to
be the privilege of setting off the fireworks
in the evening.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'll run themselves to death,&quot; commented
Debrett, who knew his young
America, &quot;and is Jimmie to be one of the
contestants?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is,&quot; replied Hawtry, &quot;it's a 'free for
all' event and even Cecelia Anne <i>may</i> start
if Jimmie allows it. She's not thinking much
about that though. You see, Jimmie has
gone into training and she's his trainer. I
went out with them last Saturday morning
to see how they manage. They marched me
down to an untenanted little farm, back
from the road. Jimmie carried the 'riffle'
referred to in Cecelia Anne's text and a
handful of blank cartridges. Cecelia Anne
carried Jimmie's sweater, a bath towel, a
large sponge, a small tin bucket and a long
green bottle. I carried nothing. I was observing,
not interfering.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that dear baby!&quot; broke in Mrs.
Hawtry, &quot;such a heavy load!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's thriving under it, my dear.&quot; Well,
presently we arrived at our destination, and
I saw that those kids had worn a little path,
not very deep of course, all round what used
to be rather a spacious 'door yard.' The
winning-post was the pump. By its side
Cecelia Anne disposed her burden like a
theatrical 'dresser' getting things ready for
his principal. She hung her tin pail on the
pump's snout and pumped it full of water,
laid it beside the bath towel, threw the
sponge into it, gave a final testing jerk to
her tight little braids and divested herself
of her jumpers and the dress she wore under
them. Then she resumed the jumpers, took
the rifle and crossed the 'track.' Jimmie,
meanwhile, had stripped to trousers and the
upper part of his bathing-suit, had donned
his running shoes, set his feet in holes kicked
in the ground for that purpose and bent forward,
his back professionally hunched and
in his hands the essential pieces of cork.
Cecelia Anne gabbled the words of starting,
shut her eyes tightly, fired the rifle into the
air, threw it on the ground and set off after
the swiftly moving Jimmie. Early in his
first lap she was up to him. As they passed
the pump, she was ahead. In the succeeding
laps she kept a comfortable distance in
the lead, until the end of the third when she
sprinted for 'home,' grabbed the towel and,
as Jimmie came bounding up, wrapped him
in it, rubbed him down, fanned him with it,
moistened his brow with vinegar from the
long bottle, tied the sweater around his neck
by its red sleeves and held the dripping
sponge to his lips. Then she found time for
me.</p>

</div>

<p>&quot;Oh, father,&quot; she cried, &quot;did you <i>ever</i> see
<i>any</i>body who could run as fast as Jimmie?
Don't you just know he'll win that
race?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There's but one chance against it,&quot; said
I. &quot;And really, Mr. Debrett, that boy can
run. He's a little bit heavy maybe, but he
holds himself well together and keeps up a
pretty good pace. I timed him and
measured up the distance roughly afterward.
It was pretty good going for a little
chap. Cecelia Anne is so much smaller that
we often forget what a little fellow he is after
all. But that baby&mdash;whew&mdash;I wish you'd
seen her fly. It wasn't running. She just
blew over the ground and arrived at the
pump as cool as a cucumber although Jimmie
was puffing like an automobile of the
vintage of 1890.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; said Jimmie to me as he lay
magnificently on the grass waiting to grow
cool while Cecelia still fanned him with the
towel, &quot;you see it don't hurt her to pace me
round the track.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Apparently not,&quot; said I, and although
he's my own boy and I know him pretty
well, I couldn't for the life of me decide
whether he, as well as Cecelia Anne, had
really failed to grasp the fact that she beats
him to a standstill every morning. I suppose
we'll know on the Fourth. If she runs,
then he does not know. But if he refuses
to let her run; it will be because he does
know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure of that,&quot; said Mrs.
Hawtry.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Cecelia Anne <i>was</i> allowed to run. First,
in a girl's race among the giggling, amateurish,
self-conscious girls whom she outdistanced
by a lap or two and, later, in the
race for all winners, where she had to compete
with Charlie Anderson, the beau of the
hotel, Len Fogarty, the milkman's son, and
her own incomparable Jimmie.</p>

<p>The master of ceremonies gave the signal
and the event of the day was on. First to
collapse was Charlie Anderson. Jimmie was
then in the lead with Len Fogarty a close
second, and Cecelia Anne beside him. So
they went for a lap. Then Jimmie, missing
perhaps the blue little figure of his pacemaker,
wavered a little, only a little, but
enough to allow Len Fogarty to forge past
him. Len Fogarty! The blatant, hated Len
Fogarty, always shouting defiance from his
father's milk-wagon! Then forward sprang
Cecelia Anne. Not for all the riches of the
earth would she have beaten Jimmie, but
not for all the glory of heaven would she
allow any one else to beat him. And so by
an easy spectacular ten seconds, she outran
Len Fogarty.</p>

<p>Then wild was the enthusiasm of the
audience and black was the brow of Len
Fogarty. A chorus of: &quot;Let a girl lick
you,&quot; &quot;Call yourself a runner,&quot; &quot;Come up
to the house an' race me baby brother,&quot; has
not a soothing effect when added to the
disappointment of being forever shut off
from the business end of rockets and Roman
candles. These things Cecelia Anne knew
and so accepted, sadly and resignedly, the
glare with which Len turned away from her
little attempts at explanations.</p>

<p>But she was not prepared, nothing in her
short life could ever have prepared her, to
find the same expression on Jimmie's face
when she broke through a shower of congratulations
and followed him up the road; to
expect praise and to meet <i>such</i> a rebuff would
have been sufficient to make even stiffer
laurels than Cecelia Anne's trail in the dust.</p>

<p>&quot;Why Jimmie,&quot; she whimpered contrary
to his most stringent rule. &quot;Why Jimmie
what's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're a sneak,&quot; said Jimmie darkly
and vouchsafed no more. There was indeed
no more to say. It was the last word
of opprobrium.</p>

<p>They pattered on in silence for a short
but dusty distance, Cecelia Anne struggling
with the temptation to lie down and die;
Jimmie upborne by furious temper.</p>

<p>&quot;Who taught you how to run?&quot; he at last
broke out. &quot;Wasn't it me? Didn't I give
you lessons every morning in the old lot?
And then didn't you go and beat me when
Len Fogarty, Charlie Anderson, Billy Van
Derwater, and all the other fellows were
there?&quot;</p>

<p>Cecelia Anne returned his angry gaze with
her blue and loyal eyes.</p>

<p>&quot;I didn't beat you 't all,&quot; she answered.
&quot;I didn't beat anybody but Len Fogarty.&quot;</p>

<p>Her mentor studied her for a while and
then a grin overspread his once more placid
features.</p>

<p>&quot;I guess it'll be all right,&quot; he condescended.
&quot;Maybe you didn't mean it the
way it looked. But say, Cecelia Anne, if
you're afraid of fire-crackers what are you
going to do about the rockets and the Roman
candles? You know sparks fly out of them
like rain. And if the smell of old cartridge
shells makes you sick, I don't know just how
you'll get along to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>The victor stopped short under the weight
of this overwhelming spoil.</p>

<p>&quot;I forgot all about it,&quot; she whispered.
&quot;Oh, Jimmie, I guess I ought to have let Len
Fogarty win that race. He could set off
rockets and Roman candles and Catherine
wheels. I guess it'll kill me when the sparks
and the smoke come out. Maybe I'd
better go and see Mr. Anstell and ask to be
excused.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aw, I wouldn't do that,&quot; Jimmie advised
her, &quot;you don't want everyone to
know about your nerve. You just tell him
your dress is too light and that you want me
to attend to the fireworks for you.&quot;</p>

<p>In the transports of gratitude to which
this knightly offer reduced her, Cecelia Anne
fared on by Jimmie's side until they reached
the house and their enquiring parents. Mrs.
Hawtry was on the steps as they came up
and she gathered Cecelia Anne into her arms.
For a moment no one spoke. Then Jimmie
made his declaration.</p>

<p>&quot;Cecelia Anne beat Len Fogarty all to
nothing. You ought to have been there to
see her.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Was there any one else in the race?&quot;
queried Mr. Hawtry in what his son considered
most questionable taste.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes,&quot; he was constrained to answer.
&quot;Charlie Anderson was in it. She beat him,
too. And I <i>started</i> with them but I thought
it would do those boys more good to be licked
by a little girl than to have me 'tend to them
myself.&quot; And Jimmie proceeded leisurely
into the house.</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't have to set off the fireworks,&quot;
Cecelia Anne explained happily.
&quot;Jimmie says I don't have to if I don't want
to. He's going to do it for me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Kind brother,&quot; ejaculated Mr. Hawtry.
And across the bright gold braids of her
little Atalanta, Mrs. Hawtry looked at her
husband.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Did</i> he know?&quot; she questioned, &quot;or did
he not? You thought we could be sure if he
let her start.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well,&quot; was Mr. Hawtry's cryptic utterance,
&quot;he knows now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then,&quot; cried Mary breathlessly,
&quot;what did they do then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then,&quot; her father obediently
continued, &quot;the two doughty knights smote
lustily with their swords. And each smote
the other on the helmet and clove him to the
middle. It was a fair battle and sightly.&quot;</p>

<p>But Mary's interest was unabated. &quot;And
then,&quot; she urged, &quot;what did they do then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Not much, I think. Even a knight of
the Table Round stops fighting for a while
when that happens to him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't they do anything 'tall?&quot; the audience
insisted. &quot;You aren't leaving it out,
are you? Didn't they bleed nor nothing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, they bled.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then tell me that part.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, they bled. They never stinteth
bleeding for three days and three nights
until they were pale as the very earth for
bleeding. And they made a great dole.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then, when they couldn't bleed any
more nor make any more dole, what did they
do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They died.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's the end of the story,&quot; said the
narrator definitely.</p>

<p>&quot;Then tell me another,&quot; she pleaded,
&quot;and don't let them die so soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There wouldn't be time for another long
one,&quot; he pointed out as he encouraged his
horse into an ambling trot. &quot;We are nearly
there now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After supper will you tell me one?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he promised.</p>

<p>&quot;One about Lancelot and Elaine?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Anything you
choose.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I choose Lancelot,&quot; she declared.</p>

<p>&quot;A great many ladies did,&quot; commented
her father as the horse sedately stopped before
the office of the Arcady <i>Herald-Journal</i>,
of which he was day and night editor, sporting
editor, proprietor, society editor, chief of
the advertising department, and occasionally
type-setter and printer and printer's devil.</p>

<p>Mary held the horse, which stood in need
of no such restraint, while this composite of
newspaper secured his mail, and then they
jogged off through the spring sunshine, side
by side, in the ramshackle old buggy on a
leisurely canvass of outlying districts in
search of news or advertisements, or suggestions
for the forthcoming issue.</p>

<p>In the wide-set, round, opened eyes of his
small daughter, Herbert Buckley was the
most wonderful person in the world. No
stories were so enthralling as his. No songs
so tuneful, no invention so fertile, no temper
so sweet, no companionship so precious. And
her nine happy years of life had shown her no
better way of spending summer days or winter
evenings than in journeying, led by his hand
and guided by his voice, through the pleasant
ways of Camelot and the shining times of
chivalry.</p>

<p>Upon a morning later in this ninth summer
of her life Mary was perched high up in an
apple tree enjoying the day, the green apples,
and herself. The day was a glorious one in
mid July, the apples were of a wondrous
greenness and hardness, and Mary, for the
first time in many weeks, was free to enjoy
her own society. A month ago a grandmother
and a maiden aunt had descended
out of the land which had until then given
forth only letters, birthday presents, and
Christmas cards. And they had proved to
be not at all the idyllic creatures which these
manifestations had seemed to prophesy, but a
pair of very interfering old ladies with a manner
of over-ruling Mary's gentle mother, brow-beating
her genial father and cloistering herself.</p>

<p>This morning had contributed another female
assuming airs of instant intimacy. She
had gone up to the last remaining spare
chamber, donned a costume all of crackling
white linen, and had introduced herself,
entirely uninvited, into the dim privacy of
Mary's mother's room, whence Mary had
been sternly banished.</p>

<p>&quot;Another aunt!&quot; was the outcast's instant
inference, as in a moment of accountable preoccupation
on the part of the elders she had
escaped to her own happy and familiar country&mdash;the
world of out-of-doors&mdash;where female
relatives seldom intruded, and where the
lovely things of life were waiting.</p>

<p>When she had consumed all the green
apples her constitution would accept, and
they seemed pitifully few to her more robust
mind, she descended from the source of her
refreshment and set out upon a comprehensive
tour of her domain. She liked living
upon the road to Camelot. It made life
interesting to be within measurable distance
of the knights and ladies who lived and
played and loved in the many-towered city
of which one could gain so clear a view from
the topmost branches of the hickory tree in
the upper pasture. She liked to crouch in
the elder bushes where a lane, winding and
green-arched, crossed a corner of the cornfield,
and to wait, through the long, still
summer mornings for Lancelot or Galahad
or Tristram or some other of her friends to
come pricking his way through the sunshine.
She could hear the clinking of his golden
armor, the whinnying of his steed, the soft
brushing of the branches as they parted before
his helmet or his spear; the rustling of
the daisies against his great white charger's
feet. And then there was the river &quot;where
the aspens dusk and quiver,&quot; and where
barges laden with sweet ladies passed and
left ripples of foam on the water and ripples
of light laughter in the air as, brilliant and
fair bedight, they went winding down to
Camelot.</p>

<p>This morning she revisited all these hallowed
spots. She thrilled on the very verge
of the river and quivered amid the waving
corn. She scaled the sentinel hickory and
turned her eyes upon the Southern city.
It was nearly a week since she had been allowed
to wander so far afield, and Camelot
seemed more than ever wonderful as it lay
in the shimmering distance gleaming and
glistening beyond the hills. Trails of smoke
waved above all the towers, showing where
Sir Beaumanis still served his kitchen apprenticeship
for his knighthood and his place
at the Table Round. Thousands of windows
flashed back the light.</p>

<p>&quot;I could get there,&quot; pondered Mary, &quot;if
God would send me that goat and wagon.
I guess there's quite a demand for goats and
wagons. I could dress my goat all up in
skirts like the ladies dressed their palfreys,
an' I'd wear my hair loose on my shoulders&mdash;it's
real goldy when it's loose&mdash;an' my best
hat. I guess Queen Guinevere would be
real glad to see me. Oh, dear,&quot; she fretted
as these visions came thronging back to her,
&quot;I wish Heaven would hurry up.&quot;</p>

<p>Between the pasture and the distant city
she could distinguish the roofs of another of
the havens of her dear desire&mdash;the house
where the old ladies lived. Four old ladies
there were, in the sweet autumn of their
lives, and Mary's admiration of them was as
passionate as were all her psychic states.
She never could be quite sure as to which of
the four she most adored. There was the
gentle Miss Ann, who taught her to recite
verses of piercing and wilting sensibility;
the brisk Miss Jane, who explained and
demonstrated the construction of many an
old-time cake or pastry; the silent Miss
Agnes, who silently accepted assistance in
her never-ending process of skeletonizing
leaves and arranging them in prim designs
upon cardboard, and the garrulous Miss
Sabina, who, with a crochet needle, a hair-pin,
a spool with four pins driven into it,
knitting needles and other shining implements,
could fashion, and teach Mary to
fashion, weavings and spinnings which might
shame the most accomplished spider. Aided
by her and by the re-enforced spool above
mentioned, Mary had already achieved five
dirty inches of red woollen reins for the expected
goat. But the house was distant
just three fields, a barb-wire fence, a low
stone wall, and a cross bull, and Mary knew
that her unaccustomed leisure could not be
expected to endure long enough for so perilous
a pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Her dissatisfied gaze wandered back to
her quiet home surrounded by its neatly
laid out meadows, cornfield, orchard, barns,
and garden. And a shadow fell upon her
wistful little face.</p>

<p>&quot;That old aunt,&quot; she grumbled, &quot;she
makes me awful tired. She's always pokin'
round an' callin' me.&quot;</p>

<p>Such, indeed, seemed the present habit
and intent of the prim lady who was approaching,
alternately clanging a dinner-bell
and calling in a tone of resolute sweetness:</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, O Mary, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary parted the branches of her tree and
watched, but made no sound.</p>

<p>&quot;Mary,&quot; repeated the oncoming relative,
&quot;Mary, I want to tell you something,&quot; and
added as she spied her niece's abandoned
sunbonnet on the grass, &quot;I know you're here
and I shall wait until you come to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I <i>ain't</i> coming,&quot; announced the Dryad,
and thereby disclosed her position, both
actual and mental. &quot;I suppose it's something
I've done and I don't want to hear it,
so there!&quot; Then, her temper having been
worn thin by much admonishing, she anticipated:
&quot;I <i>ain't</i> sorry I've been bad. I
<i>ain't</i> ashamed to behave so when my mamma
is sick in bed. And I don't care if you
<i>do</i> tell my papa when he comes home
to-night.&quot;</p>

<p>The intruding relative, discerning her,
stopped and smiled. And the smile was as
a banderilla to her niece's goaded spirit.</p>

<p>&quot;Jiminy!&quot; gasped that young person,
&quot;she's got a smile just like a teacher.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mary, dear,&quot; the intruder gushed, &quot;God
has sent you something.&quot;</p>

<p>The hickory flashed forth black and white
and red. Mary stood upon the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are they?&quot; she demanded.</p>

<p>&quot;They?&quot; repeated the lady. &quot;There is
only one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why, I prayed for two. Which did he
send?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Which do you think?&quot; parried the lady.
&quot;Which do you hope it is?&quot;</p>

<p>Even Mary's scorn was unprepared for
this weak-mindedness. &quot;The goat, of
course,&quot; she responded curtly. &quot;Is it the
goat?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Goat!&quot; gasped the scandalized aunt.
&quot;Goat! Why, God has sent you a baby
sister, dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;A sister! a baby!&quot; gasped Mary in her
turn. &quot;I don't <i>need</i> no sister. I prayed for
a goat just as plain as plain. 'Dear God,'
I says, 'please bless everybody, and make
me a good girl, an' send me a goat an' wagon.'
And they went an' changed it to a baby
sister! Why, I never s'posed they made mistakes
like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Crestfallen and puzzled she allowed herself
to be led back to the darkened house
where her grandmother met her with the
heavenly substitute wrapped in flannel. And
as she held it against the square and unresponsive
bosom of her apron she realized
how the &quot;Bible gentleman&quot; must have felt
when he asked for bread and was given a
stone.</p>

<p>During the weeks that followed, the weight
of the stone grew heavier and heavier while
the hunger for bread grew daily more acute.
Not even the departure of interfering relatives
could bring freedom, for the baby's
stumpy arms bound Mary to the house as
inexorably as bolts and bars could have done.
She passed weary hours in a hushed room
watching the baby, when outside the sun
was shining, the birds calling, the apples
waxing greener and larger, and the shining
knights and ladies winding down to Camelot.
She sat upon the porch, still beside the baby,
while the river rippled, the wheatfields
wimpled, and the cows came trailing down
from the pasture, down from the upland
pasture where the sentinel hickory stood
and watched until the sun went down, and,
one by one, the lights came out in distant
Camelot. She listened for the light laughter
of the ladies, the jingling of the golden armor,
the swishing of the branches and of the
waves. Listened all in vain, for Theodora,
that gift of God, had powerful lungs and a
passion for exercising them so that minor
sounds were overwhelmed and only yells
remained.</p>

<p>But the deprivation against which she
most passionately rebelled was that of her
father's society. Before the advent of Theodora
she had been his constant companion.
They were perfectly happy together, for the
poet who at nineteen had burned to challenge
the princes of the past and to mold the
destinies of the future was, at twenty-nine,
very nearly content to busy himself about
the occurrences of the present and to edit a
weekly paper in the town which had known
and honored his father, and was proud of,
if puzzled by, their well-informed debonair
son. Even himself he sometimes puzzled.
He knew that this was not to be his life's
work, this chronicling of the very smallest
beer, this gossip and friendliness and good
cheer. But it served to fill his leisure and
his modest exchequer until such time as he
could finish his great tragedy and take his
destined place among the writers of his time.
Meanwhile, he told himself, with somewhat
rueful humor, there was always an editor
ready to think well of his minor poems and
an audience ready to marvel at them, &quot;which
is more, my dear,&quot; he pointed out to his
admiring wife, &quot;than Burns could have said
for himself&mdash;or Coleridge.&quot;</p>

<p>And when his confidence and his hopes
flickered, as the strongest of hopes and confidence
sometimes will, when his tragedy
seemed far from completion, his paper paltry,
and his life narrow, he could always
look into his daughter's eyes and there find
faith in himself and strength and sunny
patience.</p>

<p>Formerly these fountains of perpetual
youth had been beside him all the long days
through. From village to village, from store
to farm, they had jogged, side by side, in a
lazy old buggy; he smoking long, silent
pipes, perhaps, or entertaining his companion
with tales and poems of the days of
chivalry when men were brave and women
fair and all the world was young. And,
Mary, inthralled, enrapt, adoring her father,
and seeing every picture conjured up by his
sonorous rhythm or quaint phrase, was much
more familiar with the deeds and gossip of
King Arthur's court than with events of her
own day and country.</p>

<p>So that while Mary, tied to the baby,
yearned for the wide spaces of her freedom,
Mr. Buckley, lonely in a dusty buggy, jogging
over the familiar roads, thought longingly
of a little figure in an irresponsible
sunbonnet, and found it difficult to bear
patiently with matronly neighbors, who congratulated
him upon this arrangement, and
assured him that his little play-fellow would
now quickly outgrow her old-fashioned ways
and become as other children, &quot;which she
would never have, Mr. Buckley, as long as
you let her tag around with you and filled
her head with impossible nonsense.&quot;</p>

<p>It was not a desire for any such alteration
which made him acquiesce in the separation.
It was a very grave concern for his wife's
health, and a very sharp realization that,
until he could devise some means of increasing
his income, he could not afford to engage
a more experienced nurse for the new arrival.
He had no ideas of the suffering entailed
upon his elder daughter. He was deceived,
as was every one else, by the gentle uncomplainingness
with which she waited upon
Theodora, for whose existence she regarded
herself as entirely to blame. Had she not,
without consulting her parents, applied to
high heaven for an increase in live stock, and
was not the answer to this application, however
inexact, manifestly her responsibility.</p>

<p>&quot;They're awful good to me,&quot; she pondered.
&quot;They ain't scolded me a mite, an'
I just know how they must feel about it.
Mamma ain't had her health ever since that
baby come, an' papa looks worried most to
death. If they'd 'a' sent that goat an' wagon
I could 'a' took mamma riding. Ain't prayers
terrible when they go wrong!&quot; And in
gratitude for their forbearance she, erstwhile
the companion, or at least the audience, of
fealty knight and ladies, bowed her small
head to the swathed and shapeless feet of
heaven's error and became waiting woman
to a flannel bundle.</p>

<p>Only her dreams remained to her. She
could still look forward to the glorious time
of &quot;when I'm big.&quot; She could still unbind
her dun-colored hair and shake it in the sun.
She could still quiver with anticipation as
she surveyed her brilliant future. A beautiful
prince was coming to woo her. He would
ride to the door and kneel upon the front
porch while all his shining retinue filled the
front yard and overflowed into the road.
Then she would appear and, since these
things were to happen in the days of her
maturity, perhaps when she was twelve years
old, she would be radiantly beautiful, and her
hair would be all goldy gold and curly, and
it would trail upon the ground a yard or two
behind her as she walked. And the prince
would be transfixed. And when he was all
through being that&mdash;Mary often wondered
what it was&mdash;he would arise and sing &quot;Nicolette,
the Bright of Brow,&quot; or some other
disguised personality, while all his shining
retinue would unsling hautboys and lyres
and&mdash;and&mdash;mouth organs and play ravishing
music.</p>

<p>And when she rode away to be the prince's
bride and to rule his fair lands, her father
and her mother should ride with her, all in
the sunshine of the days &quot;when I'm big&quot;&mdash;the
wonderful days &quot;when I'm big.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, being but little, she served the
flannel bundle even as Sir Beaumanis had
served a yet lowlier apprenticeship. But she
still stormed high heaven to rectify its mistake.</p>

<p>&quot;And please, dear God, if you are all out
of goats and wagons, send rabbits. But
anyway come and take away this baby.
My mamma ain't well enough to take care of
it an' I can't spare the time. We don't
need babies, but we do need that goat and
wagon.&quot;</p>

<p>And the powers above, with a mismanagement
which struck their petitioner dumb,
sent a wagon&mdash;only a wagon&mdash;and it was a
gocart for the baby, and Mary was to be the
goat.</p>

<p>With this millstone tied about her neck she
was allowed to look upon the scenes of her
early freedom, and no inquisitor could have
devised a more anguishing torture than that
to which Mary's suffering and unsuspecting
mother daily consigned her suffering and
uncomplaining daughter.</p>

<p>&quot;Walk slowly up and down the paths,
dear, and don't leave your sister for a moment.
Isn't it nice that you have somebody
to play with now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; said Mary. &quot;But she ain't
what I'd call playful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You used to be so much alone,&quot; Mrs.
Buckley continued. Mary breathed sharply,
and her mother kissed her sympathetically.
&quot;But now you always have your sister with
you. Isn't it fine, dearie?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am,&quot; repeated the victim, and
bent her little energies to the treadmill task
of wheeling the gocart to the orchard gate,
where all wonders began, and then, with an
effort as exhausting to the will as to the
body, turning her back upon the lane, the
river, and the sentinel tree, to trundle her
Juggernaut between serried rows of cabbages
and carrots.</p>

<p>Then slowly she began to hate, with a
deep, abiding hatred, the flannel bundle.
She loathed the very smell of flannel before
Theodora was six short weeks old, and the
sight of the diminutive laundry, which hung
upon the line between the cherry trees, almost
drove her to arson.</p>

<p>The shy, quick-darting creature&mdash;half child
and half humming bird&mdash;was forced to drag
that monstrous perambulator on all her expeditions.
After a month's confinement to
the garden, where knights and ladies never
penetrate, she managed to bump her responsibility
out into the orchard. But the
glory was all in the treetops, and Mary soon
grew restless under her mother's explicit
directions. &quot;Up and down the walks&quot;
meant imprisonment, despair. Theodora
should have tried to make her role of Albatross
as acceptable as it might be made to
the long-suffering mariner about whose neck
she hung, but she showed a callousness and
a heartless selfishness which nothing could
excuse. Mary would sometimes plead with
all gentleness and courtesy for a few short
moments' freedom.</p>

<p>&quot;Theodora,&quot; she would begin, &quot;Theodora,
listen to me a minute,&quot; and the gift of God
would make aimless pugilistic passes at her
interlocutor.</p>

<p>&quot;O Theodora, I'm awful tired of stayin'
down here on the ground. Wouldn't you
just as lieves play you was a mad bull an'
I was a lady in a red dress?&quot;</p>

<p>Theodora, after some space spent in apparent
contemplation, would wave a cheerful
acquiescence.</p>

<p>&quot;An' then I'll be scared of you, an' I'll
run away an' climb as high as anything in
the hickory tree up there on the hill. Let's
play it right now, Theodora. There's something
I want to see up there.&quot;</p>

<p>Taking her sister's bland smile for ratification
and agreement, Mary would set about
her personification, shed her apron lest its
damaged appearance convict her in older
eyes, and speed toward her goal. But the
mad bull's shrieks of protest and repudiation
would startle every bit of chivalry for miles
and miles around.</p>

<p>Several experiences of this nature taught
Mary, that, in dealing with infants of changeable
and rudimentary mind, honesty was an
impossible policy and candor a very boomerang,
which returned and smote one with
savage force. So she stooped to guile and
detested the flannel all the more deeply because
of the state to which it was debasing
an upright conscience and a high sense of
honor.</p>

<p>At first her lapses from the right were all
negative. She neglected the gift of God.
She would abandon it, always in a safe and
shady spot and always with its covers
smoothly tucked in, its wabbly parasol adjusted
at the proper angle, and always with
a large piece of wood tied to the perambulator's
handle by a labyrinth of elastic
strings. These Mary had drawn from abandoned
garters, sling shots, and other mysterious
sources, and they allowed the wood
to jerk unsteadily up and down, and to
soothe the unsuspecting Theodora with a
spasmodic rhythm very like the ministrations
of her preoccupied nurse.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the nurse would be far afield
upon her own concerns, and Theodora was
never one of them. The river, the lane, the
tall hickory knew her again and again.
Camelot shone out across the miles of hill
and tree and valley. But the river was
silent and the lane empty, and Camelot
seemed very far as autumn cleared the air.
Perhaps this was because knights and ladies
manifest themselves only to the pure of heart.
Perhaps because Mary was always either consciously
or subconsciously listening for the
recalling shrieks of the abandoned and disprized
gift of God.</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it, I tell you,&quot; she admonished her
purple-faced and convulsive charge one afternoon
when all the world was gold. &quot;Stop
it, or mamma will be coming after us, and
making us stay on the back porch.&quot; But
Theodora, in the boastfulness of her new
lungs, yelled uninterruptedly on. Then did
Mary try cajolery. She removed her sister
from the perambulator and staggered back
in a sitting posture with suddenness and
force. The jar gave Theodora pause, and
Mary crammed the silence full of promise.
&quot;If you'll stop yellin' now I'll see that my
prince husband lets you be a goose-girl on
the hills behind our palace. Its awful nice
being a goose-girl,&quot; she hastened to add lest
the prospect fail to charm. &quot;If I didn't
have to marry that prince an' be a queen I
guess I'd been a goose-girl myself. Yes,
sir, it's lovely work on the hills behind a
palace with all the knights ridin' by an'
sayin', 'Fair maid, did'st see a boar pass by
this way?' You don't have to be afraid&mdash;you'd
never have to see one. In all the
books the goose-girls didn't never see no
boars, and the knights gave 'em a piece of
gold an' smiled on 'em, and the sunshine
shined on 'em, an' they had a lovely time.&quot;</p>

<p>Having stumbled into the road to peace of
conscience, Mary trod it bravely and joyously.
Theodora's future rank increased
with the decrease of her present comfort,
but her posts, though lofty and remunerative,
were never such as would bring her into
intimate contact with the person of the
queen.</p>

<p>She was betrothed to the son of a noble,
and very distant, house after an afternoon
when the perambulator, ill-trained to cross-country
work, balked at the first stone wall
on the way to the old ladies' house. It was
then dragged backward for a judicious distance
and faced at the obstacle at a mad
gallop. Umbrella down, handle up, wheels
madly whirring, it was forced to the jump.</p>

<p>Again it refused, reared high into the air,
stood for an instant upon its hind wheels and
then fell supinely on its side, shedding its
blankets, its pillows, and Theodora upon
the cold, hard stones.</p>

<p>After that her rise was rapid, and the
distance separating her from her sister's
elaborate court more perilous and more beset
with seas and boars and mountains and
robbers. She was allowed to wed her high-born
betrothed when she had been forgotten
for three hours while Mary learned a heart-rending
poem commencing, &quot;Oh, hath she
then failed in her troth, the beautiful maid
I adore?&quot; until even Miss Susan could only
weep in intense enjoyment and could suggest;
no improvement in the recitation.</p>

<p>On another occasion Mary was obliged to
borrow the perambulator for the conveyance
of leaves and branches with which to build
a bower withal; and Theodora, having been
established in unfortunate proximity to an
ant hill, was thoroughly explored by its inhabitants
ere her ministering sister realized
that her cries and agitation were anything
more than her usual attitude of protest
against whatever chanced to be going on.
By the time the bower was finished and the
perambulator ready for its customary occupant
that young person was in a position
to claim heavy damages.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't you care,&quot; said Mary cheerfully,
as she relieved Theodora from the excessive
animation. &quot;I can make it up to you when
I'm big. My prince husband&mdash;I guess he'd
better be a king by that time&mdash;will go over
to your country an' kill your husband's
father an' his grandfather an' all the kings
an' princes until there's nobody only your
husband to be king. Then you'll be a queen
you see, an' live in a palace. So now hush up.&quot;
And one future majesty was rocked upside down
by another until the royal face of the younger
queen was purple and her voice was still.</p>

<p>Mary found it more difficult to quiet her
new and painful agnosticism, and in her
efforts to reconcile dogma with manifestation
she evolved a series of theological and
economical questions which surprised her
father and made her mother's head reel.
She further manifested a courteous attention
when the minister came to call, and she engaged
him in spiritual converse until he
writhed again. For a space her investigations
led her no whither, and then, without
warning, the man of peace solved her dilemma
and shed light upon her path.</p>

<p>A neighbor ripe in years and good works
had died. The funeral was over and the
man of God had stopped to rest in the pleasant
shade of Mrs. Buckley's trees and in
the pleasant sound of Mrs. Buckley's voice.
Mary, the gocart, and Theodora completed
the group, and the minister spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;A good man,&quot; he repeated, &quot;Ah, Mrs.
Buckley, he will be sadly missed! But the
Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away.
Blessed be&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When?&quot; demanded Mary breathlessly.
&quot;When does he take away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In His own good time.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Tis not for sinful man to say. He sends
His message to the man in the pride of his
youth or to the babe in its cradle. He
reaches forth His hand and takes away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But when&mdash;&quot; Mary was beginning when
her mother, familiar with the Socratic nature
of her daughter's conversation and its
exhaustive effect upon the interlocutor, interposed
a remark which guided the current
of talk out of heavenly channels and back
to the material plain.</p>

<p>But Mary had learned all that she cared
to know. It was not necessary that she
should suffer the exactions of the baby or
subject her family to them. The Lord had
given and would take away! The minister
had said so, and the minister knew all about
the Lord. And if the powers above were
not ready to send for the baby, it would be
easy enough to deposit it in the Lord's own
house, which showed its white spire beyond
the first turn in the road which led to Camelot.
There the Lord would find it and take
it away. This would be, she reflected, the
quiet, dignified, lady-like thing to do. And
the morrow, she decided, would be an admirable
day on which to do it.</p>

<p>Therefore, on the morrow she carefully
decked Theodora in small finery, hung garlands
of red and yellow maple leaves upon
the perambulator, twined chains of winter-green
berries about its handle, tied a bunch
of gorgeous golden rod to its parasol, and
trundled it by devious and obscure ways to
the sacred precincts of God's house.</p>

<p>&quot;They look real well,&quot; she commented.
&quot;If I was sure about that goat I might keep
the cart, but it really ain't the right kind for
a goat. I guess I'd better take 'em back
just like they are an' when the Lord sees
how I got 'em all fancied up, he'll know I
ain't a careless child, an' maybe I'd get that
goat after all.&quot;</p>

<p>So the disprized little gifts of God were
bumped up the church steps, wheeled up the
aisle, and bestowed in a prominent spot before
the chancel rail. Some one was playing
soft music at the unseen organ, but Mary
accepted soft music as a phenomenon natural
to churches, and failed to connect it with
human agency. Sedately she set out Theodora's
bows and ruffles to the best advantage.
Carefully she rearranged the floral decorations
of the perambulator, and set her
elastic understudy in erratic motion. Complacently
she surveyed the whole and walked
out into the sunshine&mdash;free. And presently
the minister, the intricacies of a new hymn
reconciled to the disabilities of a lack of ear
and a lack of training, came out into the
body of the church, where the gifts of God,
bland in smiles and enwreathed in verdure,
were waiting to be taken away.</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Buckley's baby,&quot; was his first
thought. &quot;I wonder where that queer little
Mary is,&quot; was his second. And his third, it
came when he was tired of waiting for some
solution of his second, was an embarrassed
realization that he would be obliged to take
his unexpected guest home to its mother.
And the quiet town of Arcady rocked upon
its foundations as he did it.</p>

<p>&quot;In the church,&quot; marveled Mrs. Buckley.
&quot;How careless of Mary!&quot; she apologized,
and &quot;How good of you!&quot; she smiled. &quot;No,
I'm not in the least worried. She always
had a way of trotting off to her own diversions
when she was not with her father.
And lately she has been astonishingly patient
about spending her time with baby.
I have felt quite guilty, about it. But after
to-day she will be free, as Mr. Buckley has
found a nurse to relieve her. He was beginning
to grow desperate about Mary and me&mdash;said
we neither of us had a moment to
waste on him&mdash;and yet could not find a nurse
whom we felt we could afford. And yesterday
a young woman walked into his office
to put an advertisement in his paper for
just such a position as we had to offer. She
is a German, wants to learn English, and she
will be here this afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Perhaps your little girl resented her
coming,&quot; he suggested vaguely. &quot;Perhaps
that was the reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mary resentful!&quot; laughed Mrs. Buckley.</p>

<p>&quot;She doesn't, bless her gentle little heart,
know the meaning of the word. Besides
which we haven't told her about the girl, as
we are rather looking forward to that first
interview, and wondering how Mary will
acquit herself in a conversational Waterloo.
She can't, you know, make life miserable
and information bitter to a German who
speaks no English. 'Ja' or 'nein' alternately
and interchangeably may baffle even
her skill in questioning.&quot;</p>

<p>Mary, meanwhile, was hurrying along the
way to Camelot. She had not planned the
expedition in advance. Rather, it was
the inevitable reaction toward license which
marks the success of any revolution. She
had cast off the bonds of the baby carriage,
her time and her life were her own, and the
road stretched white and straight toward
Camelot.</p>

<p>It was afternoon and the sun was near its
setting when at last she reached the towered
city and found it in all ways delightful but
in some surprising. She was prepared for
the moat and for the drawbridge across it,
but not for the exceeding dirtiness of its
water and the dinginess of its barges. She
had expected it to be wider and perhaps
cleaner, and the castles struck her as being
ill-adapted to resist siege and the shocks of
war since nearly all their walls were windows.
And through these windows she caught
glimpses of the strangest interiors which ever
palaces boasted. Miles and acres of bare
wooden tables stood under the shade of
straight iron trees. From the trees black
ribbons depended. In the treetops there
were wheels and shining iron bars, and all
about the tables there were other iron bars
and bolts and bands of greasy leather.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't see a round table anywhere,&quot;
she reflected. &quot;What do you s'pose they
do with all those little square ones?&quot; She
sought the answer to this question through
many a dirty pane and many a high-walled
street. But the palaces and the streets were
empty and the explorer discovered with a
quick-sinking heart and confidence that she
was alone and hungry and very far from
home. She was treading close upon the
verge of tears when her path debouched
upon the central square of Camelot. And
straightway she forgot her doubts and puzzlements,
her hunger and her increasing
weariness, for she had found &quot;The Court.&quot;
Across a fair green plaisance, all seemly beset
with flower and shrub, the wide doors of
a church stood open. Tall palaces were all
about, and in every window, on every step,
on the green benches which dotted the plaisance,
on every possible elevation or post of
observation, the good folk of Camelot stood
or hung or even fought, to watch the procession
of beauty and chivalry as it came
foaming down the steps, broke into eddies,
and disappeared among the thronging carriages.
Mary found it quite easy to identify
the illustrious personages in the procession
when once she had realized that they would,
of course, not be in armor on a summer's
afternoon, and at what even, to her inexperienced
eyes, was manifestly a wedding.</p>

<p>First to emerge was a group of the younger
knights, frock-coated, silk-hatted, pale gray
of waistcoat and gloves, white and effulgent
of <i>boutonni&egrave;re</i>. Excitement, almost riot, resulted
among the much-caparisoned horses,
the much-favored coachmen, and the much-beribboned
equipages of state. But the noise
increased to clamor and eagerness to violence
when an ethereal figure in floating tulle and
clinging lace was led out into the afternoon
light by a more resplendent edition of black-coated,
gray-trousered knighthood.</p>

<p>The next wave was all of pink chiffon and
nodding plumes. The first wave, after trickling
about the carriages and the coachmen,
receded up the steps again to be lost and
mingled in the third, and then both swept
down to the carriages again and were absorbed.
Then the steady tide of departing
royalty set in. Then horses plunged, elderly
knights fussed, court ladies commented upon
the heat, the bride, the presents, or their
neighbors. Then the bride's father mopped
his brow and the bridegroom's mother wept
a little. Then there was much shaking or
waving of hands or of handkerchiefs. Then
the bridal carriage began to move, the bride
began to smile, and rice and flowers and
confetti and good wishes and slippers filled
the air. Then other carriages followed, then
the good folk of Camelot followed, an aged
man closed the wide church doors, and the
square was left to the sparrows, pink sunshine,
confetti, rice, and Mary.</p>

<p>The little pilgrim's sunbonnet was hanging
down her back, her hair was loose upon
her shoulders, &quot;an' real goldy&quot; where it
caught the sun, and her eyes were wide and
deep with happiness and faith. She crossed
the wide plaisance and stood upon the steps,
she gathered up three white roses and a
shred of lace, she sat down to rest upon the
topmost step, she laid her cheek against the
inhospitable doors, and, in the language of the
stories she loved so well, &quot;so fell she on sleep&quot;
with the tired flowers in her tired hands.</p>

<p>And there Herbert Buckley found her.
He had traveled far afield on that autumn
afternoon; but it is not every day that the
daughter of the owner of one-half the mills
in a manufacturing town is married to the
owner of the other half, and when such things
do occur to the accompaniment of illustrious
visitors, a half-holiday in all the mills, perfect
weather, and unlimited hospitality, it
behooves the progressive journalist and reporter
for miles around to sing &quot;haste to the
wedding,&quot; and to draw largely upon his
adjectives and his fountain pen. The editorial
staff of the Arcady <i>Herald-Journal</i>
turned homeward, and was evolving phrases
in which to describe that gala day when his
eye caught the color of a familiar little sunbonnet,
the outline of a familiar little figure.
But such a drooping little sunbonnet! Such
a relaxed little figure! Such a weary little
face! And such a wildly impossible place
in which to find a little daughter. Then he
remembered having seen Miss Ann and Miss
Agnes among the spectators and his wonder
changed to indignation.</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when Mary opened her
eyes again and found herself sheltered in her
father's arm and rocked by the old familiar
motion of the buggy.</p>

<p>&quot;And then,&quot; she prompted sleepily as
her old habit was, &quot;what did they do
then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They were married,&quot; his quiet voice
replied.</p>

<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, then they went away together and
lived happily ever after.&quot;</p>

<p>For some space there was silence and a
star came out. Mary watched it drowsily
and then drowsily began:</p>

<p>&quot;When I was to Camelot&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; demanded her father.</p>

<p>&quot;When I was to Camelot,&quot; she repeated,
cuddling close to him as if to show that there
were dearer places than that gorgeous city,
&quot;I saw a knight and a lady getting married.
And lots of other knights were there&mdash;they
didn't wear their fighting clothes&mdash;and lots
of other ladies, pink ones. An' Arthur wore
a stovepipe hat an' Guinevere wore a white
dress, an' she had white feathers in her
crown. An' Lancelot, he was there, all
getting married. Daddy, dear,&quot; she broke
off to question, &quot;were you ever to Camelot?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yes, I was there,&quot; he answered, &quot;but
it was a great many years ago.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Did you find roses?&quot; she asked, exhibiting
her wilted treasures.</p>

<p>&quot;I found your mother there, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then, what did you do then?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then we were married and lived
happily ever after.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There was you, and we lived happier
ever after.&quot;</p>

<p>And Mary fell on sleep again in the shelter
of her father's arm while the stars came out
and the glow of joyant Camelot lit all the
southern sky.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="GREAT_OAKS_FROM" id="GREAT_OAKS_FROM"></a>GREAT OAKS FROM LITTLE ACORNS</h2>


<p>Among the influences which, in America,
promote harmony between alien
races, the public school plays a most
important part. The children, the teachers,
the parents&mdash;whether of emigrant or native
origin&mdash;the relatives and friends in distant
countries, are all brought more or less under
its amalgamating influences. In the schoolroom
the child finds friends and playmates
belonging to races widely different from his
own; there Greek meets not only Greek,
but Turk, American, Irish, German, French,
English, Italian and Hungarian, and representatives
of every other nation under the
sun. The lion lying down with the lamb was
nothing to it, because the lamb, though its
feelings are not enlarged upon, must have
been distinctly uncomfortable. But in the
schoolroom Jew and Gentile work and play
together; and black and white learn love and
knowledge side by side.</p>

<p>And long after more formal instruction
has faded with the passing of the years a man
of, perhaps, German origin will think kindly
of the whole irresponsible Irish race when
he remembers little Bridget O'Connor, who
sat across the aisle in the old Cherry Street
school, her quick temper and her swift
remorse.</p>

<p>Of course, all these nationalities are rarely
encountered in one district, but a teacher
often finds herself responsible for fifty children
representing five or six of them. In
the lower grades eight or ten may be so
lately arrived as to speak no English. The
teacher presiding over this polyglot community
is often, herself, of foreign birth, yet
they get on very well together, are very fond
of one another, and very happy. The little
foreigners, assisted by their more well-informed
comrades, learn the language of the
land, I regret to say that it is often tinctured
with the language of the Bowery, in from
six to twelve weeks, six weeks for the Jews,
and twelve for the slower among the Germans'
children. And again, it will be difficult
to stir Otto Schmidt, at any stage of his
career, into antagonism against the Jewish
race, when he remembers the patience and
loving kindness with which Maxie Fishandler
labored with him and guided his first steps
through the wilderness of the English tongue.</p>

<p>These indirect but constant influences are
undeniably the strongest, but at school the
child is taught in history of the heroism and
the strength of men and nations other than
his own; he learns, with some degree of consternation,
that Christopher Columbus was
a &quot;Dago,&quot; George Washington an officer in
the English Army, and Christ, our Lord, a
Jew. Geography, as it is now taught with
copious illustrations and descriptions, shows
undreamed-of beauties in countries hitherto
despised. And gradually, as the pupils move
on from class to class, they learn true democracy
and man's brotherhood to man.</p>

<p>But the work of the American public
school does not stop with the children who
come directly under its control. The board
of education reaches, as no other organization
does, the great mass of the population.
All the other boards and departments established
for the help and guidance of these
people only succeed in badgering and frightening
them. They are met, even at Ellis
Island, by the board of health and they are
subjected to all kinds of disagreeable and
humiliating experiences culminating sometimes
in quarantine and sometimes in deportation.
Even after they have passed the
barrier of the emigration office, the monster
still pursues them. It disinfects their
houses, it confiscates the rotten fish and
vegetables which they hopefully display on
their push-carts, it objects to their wrenching
off and selling the plumbing appliances in
their apartments, it interferes with them
in twenty ways a day and hedges them round
about with a hundred laws which they can
only learn, as Parnell advised a follower
to learn the rules of the House of Commons,
by breaking them.</p>

<p>Then comes the department of street
cleaning, with its extraordinary ideas of the
use of a thoroughfare. The new-comer is
taught that the street is not the place for
dead cats and cabbage stalks, and other
trifles for which he has no further use. Neither
may it be used, except with restrictions,
as a bedroom or a nursery. The emigrant,
puzzled but obliging, picks his progeny out
of the gutter and lays it on the fire-escape.
He then makes acquaintance of the fire department,
and listens to its heated arguments.
So perhaps he, still willing to please,
reclaims the dead cat and the cabbage stalk,
and proceeds to cremate them in the privacy
of the back yard. Again the fire department,
this time in snorting and horrible
form, descends upon him. And all these
manifestations of freedom are attended by
the blue-coated police who interdict the few
relaxations unprovided for by the other
powers. These human monsters confiscate
stilettos and razors; discourage pocket-picking,
brick-throwing, the gathering of crowds
and the general enjoyment of life. Their
name is legion. Their appetite for figs, dates,
oranges and bananas and graft is insatiable;
they are omnipresent; they are argus-eyed;
and their speech is always, &quot;Keep movin'
there. Keep movin'.&quot; And all these baneful
influences may be summoned and set in
action by another, but worse than all of
them, known as the Gerry Society. This
tyrant denies the parent's right in his own
child, forbids him to allow a minor to work
in sweatshop, store, or even on the stage,
and enforces these commands, even to the
extreme of removing the child altogether and
putting it in an institution.</p>

<p>In sharp contrast to all these ogres, the
board of education shines benignant and
bland. Here is power making itself manifest
in the form of young ladies, kindly of eye and
speech, who take a sweet and friendly interest
in the children and all that concerns
them. Woman meets woman and no policeman
interferes. The little ones are cared
for, instructed, kept out of mischief for five
hours a day, taught the language and customs
of the country in which they are to
make their living or their fortunes; and
generally, though the board of education
does not insist upon it, they are cherished
and watched over. Doctors attend them,
nurses wait upon them, dentists torture them,
oculists test them.</p>

<p>Friendships frequently spring up between
parent and teacher, and it often lies in the
power of the latter to be of service by giving
either advice or more substantial aid. At
Mothers' meetings the cultivation of tolerance
still goes on. There, women of widely
different class and nationality, meet on the
common ground of their children's welfare.
Then there are roof gardens, recreation piers
and parks, barges and excursions, all designed
to help the poorer part of the city's
population&mdash;without regard to creed or nationality&mdash;to
bear and to help their children
to bear the killing heat of summer. So Jew
and Gentile, black and white, commingle;
and gradually old hostilities are forgotten
or corrected. The board of education provides
night schools for adults and free lectures
upon every conceivable interesting
topic, including the history and geography
and natural history of distant lands. Travelers
always draw large audiences to their
lectures.</p>

<p>The children soon learn to read well enough
to translate the American papers and there
are always newspapers in the different vernaculars,
so that the emigrant soon becomes
interested not only in the news of his own
country, but in the multitudinous topics
which go to make up American life. He soon
grasps at least the outlines of politics, national
and international, and before he can
speak English he will address an audience
of his fellow countrymen on &quot;Our Glorious
American Institutions.&quot;</p>

<p>It is not only the emigrant parent who
profits by the work of the public school.
The American parent also finds himself, or
generally herself, brought into friendly contact
with the foreign teachers and the foreign
friends of her children. The New York
public school system culminates in the Normal
College, which trains women as teachers,
and the College of the City of New York,
which offers courses to young men in the
profession of law, engineering, teaching, and,
besides, a course in business training. The
commencement at these institutions brings
strangely contrasted parents together in a
common interest and a common pride. The
students seem much like one another, but
the parents are so widely dissimilar as to
make the similarity of their offspring an
amazing fact for contemplation. Mothers
with shawls over their heads and work-distorted
hands sit beside mothers in Parisian
costumes, and the silk-clad woman is generally
clever enough to appreciate and to admire
the spirit which strengthened her weary
neighbor through all the years of self-denial,
labor, poverty and often hunger, which were
necessary to pay for the leisure and the education
of son or daughter. The feeling of inferiority,
of uselessness, which this realization
entails may humiliate the idle woman but
it is bound to do her good. It will certainly
deprive her conversation of sweeping criticisms
on lives and conditions unknown to
her. It will also utterly do away with many
of her prejudices against the foreigner and
it will make the &quot;Let them eat cake&quot; attitude
impossible.</p>

<p>And so the child, the parent, the teacher
and the home-staying relative are brought
to feel their kinship with all the world
through the agency of the public school, but
the teacher learns the lesson most fully,
most consciously. The value to the cause
of peace and good-will in the community of
an army of thousands of educated men and
women holding views such as these cannot
easily be over-estimated. The teachers, too,
are often aliens and nearly always of a race
different from their pupils, yet you will rarely
meet a teacher who is not delighted with
her charges.</p>

<p>&quot;Do come,&quot; they always say, &quot;and see
my little Italians, or Irish, or German, or
picaninnies; they are the sweetest little
things,&quot; or, if they be teachers of a higher
grade, &quot;They are the cleverest and the most
charming children.&quot; They are all clever in
their different ways, and they are all charming
to those who know them, and the work
of the public school is to make this charm
and cleverness appreciated, so that race
misunderstandings in the adult populations
may grow fewer and fewer.</p>

<p>The only dissatisfied teacher I ever encountered
was a girl of old Knickerbocker
blood, who was considered by her relatives
to be too fragile and refined to teach any
children except the darlings of the upper
West side, where some of the rich are democratic
enough to patronize the public school.
From what we heard of her experiences,
&quot;patronize&quot; is quite the proper word to use
in this connection. A group of us, classmates,
had been comparing notes and asked
her from what country her charges came.
&quot;Oh, they are just kids,&quot; she answered dejectedly,
&quot;ordinary every-day kids, with
Dutch cut hair, Russian blouses, belts at
the knee line, sandals, and nurses to convey
them to and from school. You never saw
anything so tiresome.&quot;</p>

<p>It grew finally so tiresome that she applied
for a transfer, and took the Knickerbocker
spirit down to the Jewish quarter, where it
gladdened the young Jacobs, Rachaels, Isadors
and Rebeccas entrusted to her care.
Her place among the nursery pets was taken
by a dark-eyed Russian girl, who found the
uptown babies, the despised &quot;just kids,&quot;
as entertaining, as lovable, and as instructive
as the Knickerbocker girl found the
Jews. Well, and so they are all of them,
lovable, entertaining and instructive, and
the man or woman who goes among them
with an open heart and eye will find much
material for thought and humility, and one
function of the public school is to promote
this understanding and appreciation. It has
done wonders in the past, and every year
finds it better equipped for its work of amalgamation.
The making of an American citizen
is its stated function, but its graduates
will be citizens not only of America. In
sympathy, at least, they will be citizens of
the world.</p>

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
